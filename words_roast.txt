The Comedy Central Roast 
of Justin Bieber. 
And now, please welcome 
your roastmaster, Kevin Hart. 
[cheers and applause] 
All right, hey. 
Y'all better clap. 
Good evening, 
ladies and gentlemen, 
my name is Kevin Hart, 
and welcome 
to The Comedy Central Roast 
of Justin Bieber. 
Here's the thing, 
Justin Bieber has 
tens of millions of fans. 
I mean, most of them 
are either in middle schools 
or standing at least 
Page 2/65
500 feet away from one. 
I mean... 
It's the truth. I'm not saying anything that's not the truth. He's a worldwide superstar. 
There's even 
a wax figure of Justin 
at Madame Tussauds 
in London. 
It's incredibly lifelike. 
I've seen it. 
He's face down 
in a wax Usher's lap. 
It's--it's weird. 
That's a dick sucking joke. 
We off to a start. 
Yeah. 
It's gonna get dirty tonight. 
Tonight--Here's the thing. 
Tonight we're gonna do 
what his parents 
and the legal system 
should have done 
a long time ago. 
We're about to give this boy 
a ass-whupping that he deserves. We are. 
We are! 
Why invite me if you 
don't want it to get ugly? 
I don't understand that. 
I mean, come on, 
we got the right dais to do it. We got Ludacris. 
We got my man Snoop Dogg, Shaq. This is crazy. 
Usually, when I see this many 
brothers sitting together, 
Maury Povich is about to open 
an envelope. 
I've never seen 
anything like it. 
Shaq, take that dumbass look 
off your face. 
Page 3/65
You look stupid. 
Here's my question. 
Shaq, how did you even 
end up on a roast? 
That's what I want to know. 
They must've called up 
the NBA pregame show 
and said, "You know what? 
Send us the third funniest guy. "Wait, he's not available? 
Send us Shaq. 
Let us get Shaq then." 
My man Snoop Dogg is here. 
There he is. 
Yeah. 
Wait, wait, 
let me clear something up 
for all the young people 
here tonight. 
Snoop Dogg is a rapper. 
Yeah, that's my aunt's 
favorite rapper. 
You know-- 
For all the black people 
that are confused 
about that old white woman 
on the couch, 
that's Martha Stewart. 
Yeah, right there. 
That's Martha Stewart 
right there. 
Martha, do me a favor and put 
your ankle bracelet on vibrate so we don't have no problems 
during the show. 
But, Martha, 
understand something. 
Tonight, it's about 
another blond bitch. 
It's about Justin Bieber. 
That's who we're talking about tonight. 
That's who we're talking 
about tonight. 
Page 4/65
So now, why don't we do this. 
Why don't we go and take a look at his huge success 
that confuses everyone 
over the age 14. 
Roll security footage 
right now. 
Our next guest has 
a mind-boggling 80 million views on YouTube, 
and he's only 15 years old. 
And I was like, 
baby, baby, baby, oh 
Like, I thought 
you'd always be mine 
I'm gone 
That's how you do it. 
Find me somebody to love 
(female news reporter) 
Justin Bieber is one of 
the biggest 
pop stars on the planet. 
(Drake) 
Now I'd like you to welcome 
my brother to the stage. 
He goes by the name 
of Justin Bieber. 
- Justin Bieber. 
- Justin Bieber. 
(Justin) 
I love you so much. 
[police siren blaring] 
(female news reporter) 
Speeding down the 101 freeway, pop star Justin Bieber 
was stopped by police. 
(male news reporter) 
The Boyfriend singer 
had just returned home 
from an overseas concert tour 
when he began racing his Ferrari through the streets. 
If I was your boyfriend 
I'd never let you go 
Page 5/65
(girl) I think about him 
99% of my life. 
I saw him in the car. 
That was the most amazing 
moment of my life. 
Best moment of my life! 
Justin Bieber said 
that he hoped Anne Frank 
would have been 
a Belieber. 
That's right, 
I didn't make that up. 
I couldn't have made that up. 
If I was your boyfriend 
Ow. 
(female news reporter) 
Bieber could face 
battery charges 
after a physical altercation 
with a photographer. 
What the [bleep] you say? 
(man) 
You watch it, man. 
- What'd you say? 
(man) You are [indistinct]. 
I'll beat the [bleep] 
out of you. 
(male news reporter) 
He was accused of throwing eggs at this mansion, 
causing $20,000 in damage. 
Were they Faberg eggs? 
What did you throw? 
Whoo! 
(female news reporter) 
Bieber is facing 
multiple charges 
after a wild night 
in Miami Beach. 
DUI alcohol or drugs, 
resisting without violence, 
driving with an expired 
driver's license. 
You're too young 
Page 6/65
to be smoking pot 
and driving up and down 
the highway fast! 
What are you doing? 
- Ah! 
- What are you doing? 
Whoo! 
I've done some things that might not have been the greatest. 
- Really? Nothing comes to mind. - I know, right? 
I don't know what 
you're talking about. 
(man) 
Justin Bieber has become 
the new face-- 
or should we say body-- 
of Calvin Klein. 
Yo, my pee-pee's in there. 
As long as you love 
The fanfare of what he is 
as a celebrity 
is only partial to what he 
ultimately will be as an artist. (Justin) 
This is not the end 
of Justin Bieber. 
As long as you love me 
[cheers and applause] 
Tonight--tonight, we're 
going to talk about redemption. [gospel organ playing] 
We're going to talk about 
second chances and third chances and 15th chances. 
Sometimes it can be 
hard to believe, 
but I'm not asking you all 
to believe. 
I'm asking you to "beliebe." 
Yes, yes. 
I'm asking you 
to "beliebe" in a man 
with the voice 
Page 7/65
of Stevie Wonder 
and the driving skills 
of Stevie Wonder. 
My question to the church is, 
"Are you ready to beliebe?" 
[cheers and applause] 
No. 
No, no, no. 
I'll ask again. 
I said, 
"Are you ready to beliebe?" 
[crowd cheering] 
Are you ready 
to become Beliebers? 
[crowd cheering] 
Then, ladies and gentlemen, 
Justin Bieber. 
[gospel music] 
(all) Got to Beliebe 
(Kevin) Yeah. 
Got to Beliebe 
He's gonna make a Belieber 
A Belieber out of me 
- Yes! 
When you Beliebe 
When you Beliebe 
You will be down, way down, 
on your bendin' knee 
I'm gonna be a Belieber 
Till the day I die 
(Kevin) Yeah. 
Shout "I beliebe" 
from the mountain high 
(Kevin) Hey. 
Got to Beliebe. 
(Kevin) Hey. 
Got to Beliebe 
He's gonna make a Belieber 
A Belieber out of me 
Oh, shit. 
Oh, shit. 
Oh, shit. 
We killed the white boy. 
The white-- 
Page 8/65
Watch out. Watch out! 
Let me through. 
Jesus, no. 
(woman) 
Oh! 
(Kevin) 
Not like this. 
Wait, wait. 
He's moving! He's moving! 
[all cheering] 
[gospel music] 
(all) 
He's still alive, 
We thought he died 
You can't kill Justin Bieber 
no matter what you try 
It's time to go 
on with the show 
But you got to-- 
Got to Belie-e-ebe 
Yeah. 
Come on. 
Yeah, oh. 
Justin Bieber, everybody. 
[cheers and applause] 
(Kevin) 
Nice. How you doing? 
(Kevin) You're good? 
- Yep. 
That's good. 
I'm glad that you're good. 
- All right. 
- Here's the thing. 
Before we get off 
to any roasting and any digging, I want everybody 
to understand this, 
Justin Bieber really does 
have it all. 
I'm serious. 
He has a dick and a pussy. 
Justin, stand up. 
Pop that thing one time. 
Show 'em. Give 'em 
Page 9/65
that hermaphrodite twerk 
one time. 
I've seen it. 
No? No? 
Let's be honest. 
Justin, you made a few mistakes. You're not perfect. 
He's done some things. 
Dude, you got caught peeing 
on a video in a mop bucket. 
Why are these idiots 
who work for you 
taping you pissing? 
That's what I don't understand. Like, when someone's 
filming you taking a piss, 
if you don't want them 
to tape you, 
you turn around, you say, 
"Turn the Goddamn camera off," 
unless it's mandatory 
like Snoop pissing 
in front of his parole officer. That's different, Snoop. 
That guy's got to see 
your dick. 
I get it. 
Don't worry about it. 
That's a criminal joke to Snoop 'cause he's been to jail. 
You were on the cover 
of Men's Health. 
He's getting 
a lot of slack 
for taking his shirt off 
all the time. 
I don't get it. 
I don't understand that. 
Justin, let me 
tell you something, man. 
Okay, if you can take 
your shirt off, you do it. 
You do it as much 
as you Goddamn can. 
Page 10/65
Seriously. 
Look at Shaq--Shaq-- 
Shaq hasn't taken his shirt off since high school, okay? 
That's a true story. 
That's a true story right there. Jeff Ross hasn't taken 
his shirt off since preschool. True story. 
Martha Stewart had her shirt off in my dressing room. 
Stop, stop, stop. 
Don't get the wrong idea. 
She just wanted me 
to titty fuck her! 
Yeah! 
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. Stop. 
I'm just trying 
to loosen y'all up. 
I'm sorry. 
Martha, I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. 
Is that gonna affect me getting free sheets after this, Martha? Please. 
I messed up my chance 
of getting free sheets, 
Goddamn it, Kevin. 
Me personally, I'm not mad. 
I'm not mad at Justin. 
I'm not. 
I'm gonna tell you 
who I'm mad at. 
I'm mad at his manager. 
You, Scooter. 
That's right. 
Scooter Braun right there. 
Scooter is the man that actually discovered Justin Bieber. 
Scooter Braun was 
25 years old. 
He was a single man 
living in Atlanta alone 
Page 11/65
when he found Justin Bieber 
on the Internet 
in the middle of the night. 
The middle of the night! 
He found a little white boy 
with nice hair on the Internet. Sounds to me like Scooter was 
fresh off a dick-beating session if you ask me. 
Now, I don't know 
where Chris Hansen is, 
but he missed one. 
That's a Goddamn predator 
if I've ever seen one 
right there. 
Now, Justin, unfortunately, 
Selena Gomez, 
she couldn't be here tonight. 
[audience "awws"] 
No, she couldn't. 
She couldn't... 
Just because 
she didn't want to come. 
There's no reason. 
She just didn't want to-- 
She didn't want to be here. 
I wish I had something better 
to tell you, but I don't. 
No, Selena got word 
that there was rumors 
of Justin dealing 
with Kendall Jenner, 
and that shocked me. 
I was like, "What the fuck?" 
That's what I said. 
"What the fuck?" 
I was like, "If you're gonna 
deal with a Jenner, 
I thought it would be Bruce." 
That's what I thought. 
If it was-- 
Just one. I'm sorry. 
That's the only one. 
I swear to God, guys, 
Page 12/65
no more. 
It's no secret that Justin 
wants to be black. 
Can we all agree on that? 
Justin loves the black culture. Everybody knows that. 
My thing is this, 
Justin, I just want you 
to come to terms with the fact that you're not gangster. 
That's Justin's 
main problem, man. 
You're not a gangster! 
Accept that. 
I mean, come on. 
Orlando Bloom took a swing 
at you. 
That's not gangster, Justin. 
It's not! 
He's got a perfume 
called "Girlfriend." 
That's not gangster, Justin. 
You threw eggs at a house. 
Gangsters don't throw 
fucking eggs! 
Snoop, when the last time 
you threw eggs 
at somebody's Goddamn house? 
We don't do that! 
It's not gangster! 
Justin--Justin sang the N-word on a video 
in a song that was 
about killing black people! 
That's pretty Goddamn gangster, Justin, I'ma give you that. 
That's as gangster as you get 
right there. 
He actually got 
in a lot of trouble 
when he got caught 
saying the N-word on video. 
That right there, that should 
make you feel stupid. 
Page 13/65
Reason why I say that, 
because you know who didn't 
get caught, Justin? 
The billion other white people that say the N-word 
every Goddamn day. 
I'm talking about you, Martha. I know you say it. 
You probably thinking it 
right now. 
"Look at--Look at that 
little nigger up there 
"in his little nigger tux. 
"With his little nigger shoes. 
Look at him, 
up there dancing." 
Thankfully, 
Justin avoided the usual-- 
I guess you could say, 
former childhood mistakes. 
You know, he hasn't had 
a sex tape. 
That's good for you. 
He hasn't killed anyone. 
You haven't bought a monkey. 
Oh, shit, you did. 
You bought a monkey. 
And you abandoned the monkey 
in Germany. 
What the fuck was that? 
Like, you abandoned a monkey 
in Germany. 
That was a privileged 
Beverly Hills monkey. 
You showed him 
your lifestyle, 
and then you 
dropped him off in Germany? 
Now that monkey's turned out 
in a Goddamn German zoo 
sucking rhino dick 
'cause of your bad decision. 
It's not about the monkey 
tonight. 
Page 14/65
It's about you, Justin. 
What I want you to do, 
I want you to sit back, 
relax, 
'cause it's gonna be 
a great night, man-- 
Not for you, 
for everybody else. 
We're gonna have a blast. 
It's on! 
You hear me, people? 
It is on! 
(announcer) Coming up...

(announcer) Hannibal Buress, 
Martha Stewart,

naughty. 
(announcer) When The Roast of 
Justin Bieber continues. 
[techno music] 
Are y'all ready to have 
a good time tonight? 
[cheers and applause] 
That's what I want to hear. 
Okay, our first roaster 
is Pete Davidson. 
Now, he's the newest member 
of Saturday Night Live. 
This introduction is way longer than his Wikipedia page. 
Page 15/65
Guy from New York, 
it's Pete Davidson. 
[techno music] 
Thank you. 
It's an honor to be at a roast hosted by Shaq's dick. 
Wow. Wow, Ludacris 
and Snoop Dogg are here. 
If I was 38, 
I'd be freaking out right now. Kev, I loved you 
as black Annie. 
He was so good. 
Ludacris! 
I don't mean you. 
I mean Jeff's career. 
No, no, I mean, 
I've been watching these roasts since I was nine, and 
what's happening to you, Jeff? You look like someone put 
Seth Rogen in the microwave. 
Martha, it's nice to see you 
interacting with black people 
for the first time since prison. That's really nice. 
Martha's so old, her first 
period was the Renaissance. 
What's up, Ludacris? 
What's up, man? 
You might know Ludacris 
from your mom's 
That's What I Call Music CD. 
Come on, 
let's hear it for Shaq, right? [cheers and applause] 
Thanks for being here 
and taking a break 
from throwing barrels 
at Super Mario. 
[laughs] 
I'm sorry. 
[laughs] 
Please don't eat me. 
Page 16/65
[laughs] 
I'm so afraid, you're so big. 
One of the many nicknames 
that Shaq has is "Superman," 
right, and much like Superman, he pretends to be a reporter 
and has never met 
his real father. 
No, no, no, no. 
Shaq is cool, though. 
Shaq has shattered 
eight backboards 
and 79 cervixes. 
Hannibal--Hannibal Buress 
is here, everybody, Hannibal. 
Hannibal, of course, is famous for exposing Bill Cosby, right, and only for exposing 
Bill Cosby. 
No, he deserved it though. 
Bill Cosby hurt those women 
without ever caring 
about the consequences-- 
that Hannibal Buress would 
become famous. 
Snoop Dogg's here. 
Snoop, I love Snoop, 
you know? 
Snoop's son just got accepted 
to play division one 
college football. 
Yeah. So Snoop Dogg 
found out he has a son. 
And now speaking of someone 
who probably doesn't know 
he has a son, 
Justin Bieber is here. 
Justin-- 
Give it up for him. 
It really is--it's really 
so cool what he's doing. 
You have no idea 
how awesome this is. 
My cast-mate on SNL, 
Page 17/65
Kate McKinnon, 
does a perfect impression 
of Justin. 
Perfect, 
right down to the clit. 
Justin has a lot of tattoos. 
You have "patience" tattooed 
on your neck, 
and "this doesn't count" 
right above his asshole. 
No, no, no, but Justin's fucked more models than bulimia. 
He's the only thing they swallow and don't throw back up. 
Justin, you know, 
I lost my dad on 9/11, 
and I always regretted 
growing up without a dad, 
until I met your dad, 
Justin. 
Now I'm glad mine's dead. 
And now for the greatest 
transition 
in the history of comedy, 
two people from the movie 
Soul Plane are here, right? 
[cheers and applause] 
Kevin, Snoop, Soul Plane was 
the worst experience of my life involving a plane. 
All right, well-- 
No, seriously, Justin, 
I just want to say how cool 
it is for you to be doing this. Like, you're the dude 
for our generation, like, 
and it's just so cool 
to see someone our age 
do exactly what he wants to do, and you just, like, 
took over the world, 
and like, 
it really is an inspiration. 
This kid's fucking insane, 
Page 18/65
so thank you, bro. 
[techno music] 
[cheers and applause] 
(Pete) I've always wanted 
to make fun of him 
because everybody my age 
likes him 
more than they like me, 
and that's not okay. 
(announcer) 
Coming up, Natasha Leggero. 
and Ludacris. 
Are you ready? 
(announcer) 
When The Roast 
of Justin Bieber continues. 
[techno music] 
All right. 
Our next roaster is 
a semi-famous rapper. 
I'm talking about Ludacris. 
His first album was called 
Incognegro, 
and his new album, Ludaverse, 
is hopefully his last. 
You may not recognize him 
from the Fast and Furious movies because when he's on-screen, 
even the white people 
start talking. 
Please welcome one of the most successful rappers of 2001, 
Ludacris! 
[Ludacris' Money Maker] 
Shake your money maker 
Like somebody about to pay you I see you on my radar 
Don't you act 
like you afraid of Shh... 
You know I got it 
If you want it, come get it 
Stand next to this money 
Like hey hey hey 
Oh, man. 
Page 19/65
Whoo. 
Make some noise for Kevin Hart, ladies and gentlemen. 
Thank you. 
[cheers and applause] 
I just recently got married. 
That's something to celebrate. And Kevin was at my wedding 
because I needed 
a miniature black man 
on my cake, 
so thank you for that. 
My good friend Shaquille O'Neal is here this evening. 
[cheers and applause] 
Look at those big-ass feet. 
Man, you got toes in different area codes right now. 
You do realize that, right? 
Shaq's fingers are so big, 
every text he's ever sent 
is just every letter 
of the alphabet 
at the same damn time. 
I'm just playing, Shaq, 
you know. 
You are truly one 
of the most original rappers. 
And by that I mean, 
most of your CDs 
are still covered 
in their original wrapper. 
You do-- 
you do know that? 
I believe the Doggfather's 
in the house tonight. 
[cheers and applause] 
Snoop, your homey Dr. Dre just became a billionaire last year, and you should be proud. 
There's not a lot 
of black billionaires. 
There's Dr. Dre 
and the guy 
Page 20/65
that sells you weed. 
Yeah. 
I mean, you are a legend, 
which is a nice way of saying, "You old as fuck." 
You only do it 
doggie style now 
because it's easier 
on your lower back. 
I see you over there laughing, Martha Stewart. 
What you laughing at, huh? 
She's so old, if you look 
closely at the $100 bill, 
you can see Martha photo-bombing Ben Franklin in the background. So let's get to the kid 
that I've known 
longer than anybody else 
up here, Mr. Justin Bieber. 
[cheers and applause] 
He may have just turned 21, 
but Justin will always be 
a baby to me 
since babies piss everywhere 
and never know 
when to shut the fuck up. 
I remember one day, 
I got this call saying, 
"We want you to collaborate 
with this little dude 
who will do anything 
to get famous," 
and I was like, 
"Great, I love Kevin Hart." 
You know? 
That's my guy. 
But this dude turned out to be Justin motherfucking Bieber, 
and together we dropped 
a track called Baby. 
[crowd cheering] 
It's got over a billion hits 
on YouTube. 
Page 21/65
That's because I'm in it. 
It also has 
4 million dislikes. 
That's because he's in it. 
It's like you try to roll 
like a gangster, man, 
but you're not tough, Justin. 
I'm here to let you know, man. I know you been on Ellen 
14 times. 
You act so much like a pussy 
on the show, 
Ellen tried to eat you. 
I mean, come on. 
But you've become 
a music icon 
like a modern day 
Michael Jackson. 
The only difference is, 
as Michael got older, 
he acted whiter. 
Justin Bieber wants 
to be black so bad, 
he actually has seen 
Kevin Hart's movies in theaters, ladies and gentlemen. 
Justin, honestly, I feel bad 
kicking you while you're down, but since you want 
to be black, 
you might as well 
get used to it, man. 
No, honestly, man, 
it takes a very brave soul 
to get up here, 
and I just want to say, 
I love you, J.B. 
I'm glad that you did this. 
This is a beautiful thing. 
Y'all make some noise 
for my man, Justin Bieber. 
[cheers and applause] 
[techno music] 
All right. 
Page 22/65
Hey, how about Ludacris? 
Come on, one time. 
One time. 
[cheers and applause] 
Everything I know 
about being a whore 
in the entertainment industry, I learned 
from this next roaster. 
Of course I'm talking about you, Natasha Leggero. 
You guys may have seen her 
on Reno 91 as a whore on drugs. If you didn't see that, 
you may have seen her 
in Neighbors 
as a whore on drugs. 
Everybody, I want you 
to pull out some Purell 
for Natasha Leggero 
right now. 
[cheers and applause] 
[techno music] 
Kevin, you look like someone 
put 50 Cent in the dryer. 
There is a lot of star power 
up here. 
These men combined 
have made millions 
in child support payments. 
Kevin, 
you are everywhere. 
You know, Kevin's actually 
gonna be on the next season 
of Game of Thrones. 
He's playing 
Peter Dinklage's shadow. 
[cheers and applause] 
Kevin does 
all of his own stunts. 
He climbs into his own chair. 
He climbs 
out of his own bathtub. 
He goes up on his wife. 
Page 23/65
Kevin has a Napoleon complex. 
Kevin, Napoleon was 
the leader of France. 
Ludacris, 
France is in Europe. 
Justin, 
Europe's a continent. 
Shaq, a continent is not 
a free breakfast. 
[cheers and applause] 
You know, a lot of people 
don't know this. 
"Shaquille" is an Arabic name 
for "handsome," 
and "O'Neal" is the Irish word for "just kidding." 
Shaq's dick is so big, 
he has to use Dropbox 
to send a dick pic. 
When I first met Hannibal, 
I was like, 
"You are going to be a star," 
and when I first met Kevin, 
I was like, 
"No, I don't want to buy 
a candy bar 
to support your local 
after-school program." 
Ludacris, not only 
is your music great, 
but I love all your movie. 
Jeff Ross, it's great 
to see you here 
once a year at these roasts. 
How's the Uber driving 
going? 
Chris D'Elia finally answers 
the question, 
"What if Dane Cook had half 
the talent and a rich father?" Sorry, let me just take a second to explain to the black guys 
on the dais what a father is. 
All right. 
Page 24/65
I'm excited Snoop's here. 
Snoop, you look 
like Shaq's skeleton. 
[cheers and applause] 
All these rappers on stage, 
and Martha Stewart has done 
the most jail time. 
[cheers and applause] 
Now, that's not fair. 
Justin Bieber, everybody. 
[cheers and applause] 
Seems like only yesterday 
you were discovered on YouTube. Time flies when you're 
a piece of shit. 
No, Justin's fans 
are called "Beliebers," 
because these days, 
it's considered 
politically incorrect 
to use the term "retards." 
Justin, 
you've been on Ellen 
more than a pussy juice 
moustache. 
Mine was better, 
Ludacris. 
Justin was born 
to a teenage single mom. 
No wonder he's got moves. 
He was in the womb 
dodging a coat hanger. 
[crowd groans] 
Justin, Selena Gomez 
had to fuck you. 
She is literally 
the least lucky Selena 
in all of entertainment 
history. 
No, Justin, 
you're so successful. 
You're so rich. 
You're like our beetles. 
Not the band, the bugs 
Page 25/65
that live in shit. 
So... 
Justin, I just want to tell you, I think that you are 
well on your way to becoming 
a handsome, young gentleman, 
and I really think that 
things are gonna get better 
after this for you, 
and thank you for-- 
Thank you for letting me 
be here and do this. 
Thank you, Justin Bieber. 
[cheers and applause] 
(announcer) 
Still to come... 
- Oh! 
(announcer) Shaquille O'Neal. 
These hands are like 
a junkie's back. 
(announcer) 
Martha Stewart. 
I think she's got a few tricks up her sleeve, right? 
(announcer) 
Snoop Dogg. 
Stop yelling at me. 
(announcer) 
Hannibal Buress, 
and Jeff Ross... 
God's pissed at you. 
Bill Cosby was 
his favorite comedian. 
[laughter] 
(announcer) 
When the Roast of Justin Bieber continues. 
[cheers and applause] 
First of all, I can't bring out our next roaster 
without giving the attention 
to Natasha Leggero 
that she deserves. 
Make some noise 
Page 26/65
for that Goddamn woman. 
You killed. 
Killed! 
All right, our next roaster 
is Shaquille O'Neal. 
[applause] 
Yeah, yeah. 
He's an NBA legend 
with a Doctorate of Education, but you wouldn't know it 
by the way that he pronounces 
"Doctorate of Education." 
Everybody, 
let's get ready to mumble! 
It's Shaquille O'Neal. 
Thank you, Webster. 
Kevin is the only celebrity 
with a star 
on the yellow brick road. 
In case you didn't know, 
I am Shaquille O'Neal. 
Shaq Diesel... 
[whooping] 
Superman, Big Aristotle, 
Big Cactus, Big Galactus, 
and Martha Stewart's 
baby daddy. 
And trust me, 
Martha know how to work 
that motherfucker, 
boy, let me tell you. 
Once you go Shaq, 
you never go back. 
Ain't that right, Martha? 
But I'm not the only 
baller here tonight. 
What's up, Snoop? 
How you doing, baby? 
Snoop made a reggae album. 
If you're a rap fan, 
you may not have it. 
But if you're a reggae fan, 
I know you don't 
fucking have it. 
Page 27/65
Look at all these scrubs 
on the stage. 
Chris D'Elia, 
Hannibal, Natasha, 
Pete Davidson, Jeff Ross-- 
I haven't seen a more 
disappointing lineup 
since the last Lakers game. 
Speaking of the game, 
my main man Chris Paul 
from the Clippers is down there. Hey, Chris, 
way you guys playing, you ain't gonna be getting a ring. 
I got four of 'em 
if you need to borrow one. 
(crowd) 
Oh! 
You guys suck. 
Jeff, how am I the one 
who played 19 seasons 
and you're the one 
who looks like 
you took 20 years of elbows 
to the face? 
You ugly motherfucker. 
Look at Jeff--Jeff got a body 
like a cafeteria lady. 
Now, as many of you know, 
I'm a police detective 
in the city of Miami. 
So, Justin, as a police 
officer of the law, 
I'm gonna give it 
to you straight, 
which I know will be 
a new experience for you. 
I got a questions, Justin. 
What kind of bitch 
eggs his neighbor's house? 
You caused $20,000 in damages. Imagine the damage 
you would have caused 
if you threw like a boy. 
Page 28/65
What are you doing dropping 
75 Gs in a Miami strip club? 
I heard the DJ 
play one of your songs, 
and the dancers complained 
their pussies were drying up. 
Justin, as a father of six, 
you gotta straighten up, son. 
You know, last year 
you were ranked 
the fifth most hated person 
of all time. 
Kim Jong-Un didn't even 
score that low. 
And he uses your music 
to fucking torture people. 
But thanks to that music, 
Justin is worth 
over $200 million... 
and in prison, 
four packs of Cools. 
Justin got a tattoo 
of Jesus on his calf. 
Why you gotta bring Jesus 
in your mess? 
That man has suffered enough. 
Seriously, Justin, 
I love ya, 
you're a platinum 
recording artist. 
Give it up. 
[cheers and applause] 
You're a model. 
Give it up. 
[cheering] 
You're a sex symbol. 
Give it up. 
[cheering] 
I just wanna say, 
Justin Timberlake, 
I fucking love you. 
Thank you. 
[upbeat music] 
Shaq's hilarious. 
Page 29/65
I'm gonna have 
Shaq's baby 
(announcer) Still to come 
on the roast of Justin Bieber, Martha Stewart... 
Actually, this is sort of 
like doing a roast turkey. 
(announcer) 
And Chris D'Elia. 
Actually, I'm up next, 
so if you're gonna 
change the channel, 
hurry up and do it. 
(announcer) 
When The Roast of Justin Bieber continues. 
[cheers and applause] 
[techno music] 
Our next roaster 
is Chris D'Elia. 
Holy shit, yeah. 
I know everybody's 
excited about this. 
If you didn't know, he's a star of the NBC show Undateable, 
and Chris's standup 
is actually unwatchable. 
I've seen it. 
It hurts. 
He is Justin Bieber's 
favorite comic, 
which is why he has "duh" 
in the middle of his name. 
Please welcome future rapist 
Chris "Duh" Elia. 
Yeah. 
[cheers and applause] 
No, seriously, keep it going 
for the ghost of Chris Tucker, everybody. 
No, Kevin's a good guy, 
and of course he's here, 
because he can't say no 
to anything. 
Page 30/65
Last week he hosted an ISIS 
beheading video on Reddit. 
What? 
What the fuck, man? 
What the fuck? 
Hey, Shaq. 
Shaq's here. 
People don't realize this, 
but Shaq, 
those "I can't breathe" 
T-shirts, 
they were about Shaq's 
last season with the Celtics. 
Jeff Ross, hey. 
How about the fact 
that if there weren't roasts, 
Jeff Ross would work 
at IKEA? 
We all do other things, which is why we're on the roasts. 
You're on the roasts because 
you're on the fucking roasts. 
Fuck yeah! 
Ludacris, what do you do now 
anyway, okay? 
You were a rapper. 
You make headphones 
that no one listens with. 
You make Hennessy 
that no one drinks. 
You're like a human 
going out of business sale. 
Snoop Dogg, what's up? 
It's cool you're here. 
You look like dead Splinter from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. 
Pete, it's really good 
to see you. 
50 Shades of Grey was based 
on your complexion. 
Pete-- 
[laughs] 
Pete is the same race as 
whatever the fuck The Rock is 
Page 31/65
and any parking attendant ever. Justin Bieber, 
the man here, huh? 
Let's hear it. 
[cheers and applause] 
Why are you here? 
This is a terrible idea. 
You're about to get fucked 
harder than Orlando Bloom 
fucked Selena Gomez. 
(audience) 
Oh! 
For a guy worth 
$200 million, 
why do you dress 
like Sharon Stone in the '90s? You look like Sisqo 
fucked Peter Pan 
and then got cast 
on Orange is the New Black. 
Baby is the most hated video 
online, like, statistically 
if you check that shit out, 
okay, 
and there are also ISIS videos online, okay? 
That means that someone saw 
a video with a guy screaming, 
"Death to America" and sawing 
someone's head off and thought, "Nope, still not worse 
than Bieber featuring Luda 
in a bowling alley." 
Thank you. 
Thank you, 
guy half my age. 
[laughs] 
Seriously, man, 
I'm proud of you. 
You have it all. 
You literally are a guy 
who has it all, 
except for respect, 
love, friends, 
Page 32/65
good parents, 
and a Grammy. 
Thank you. 
[techno music] 
[cheers and applause] 
Chris D'Elia. 
Goddamn it, Chris, 
that was dark. 
That was fucking dark. 
There was a couple times 
where I grabbed my shirt 
like, "Jesus Christ, Chris." 
But we're here. 
It's good though. 
Justin said you were fine. 
That's all that counts, right? How am I supposed to laugh 
after ISIS? 
What the fuck? 
Our next roaster 
is Martha Stewart. 
Martha. 
[cheers and applause] 
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. 
At the age of 73, 
she's the only white woman 
with more street cred 
than Luda and Snoop combined. 
True story. 
Please welcome 
five-years-to-life-style guru, Martha Stewart, 
everybody. 
[cheers and applause] 
First of all, 
thank you, Kevin Hart. 
It's really great 
to be here. 
Oh, there you are. 
Sitting and listening to you 
yell your jokes 
over the last hour is 
the hardest time I've ever done. As we all know, Kevin is 
Page 33/65
one of the biggest movie stars in the business right now, 
and he deserves it. 
He struggled for years. 
When he finally got 
his first big paycheck, 
he spent $150,000 
on a watch. 
I forget that term for that. 
It's not 
"African-American rich." 
It'll come to me. 
[cheers and applause] 
Justin, 
you know the word. 
I know you're all wondering 
why I'm here tonight. 
It's because Martha Stewart 
changes people's lives 
for the better, 
like Shaq for instance. 
When Shaq bought his house-- 
Shaq, are you listening? 
I was the first person 
he called. 
The house had 13 bedrooms, 
and I helped convert 8 of them into refrigerators. 
I believe the bedroom 
is the most important room 
in the house, but I don't 
have to tell you that, Ludacris. You have three kids 
with three different women. 
May I suggest pulling out 
sometime, and finishing 
on some fine, highly absorbent Martha Stewart bed linens? 
[cheers and applause] 
It's nice to see Snoop again. 
One of the highest rated 
episodes on my show, 
Martha Stewart Living, 
was when Snoop and I 
Page 34/65
made brownies together, 
and I've used his recipe 
ever since. 
As a matter of fact, 
I ate three of them 
right before they called 
and asked me to do this roast. Snoop, I see that you've been 
following my beauty regimen. 
You would never know 
that Snoop Dogg is 43 now, 
which is three times as long 
as actual dogs live 
and twice as long 
as most of his friends. 
[laughs] 
I taught Snoop 
that the most important thing 
in business 
is diversification. 
Besides his music career, Snoop now has produced a porn movie, and by the way, Natasha, 
you were great in that, 
so I guess that tonight's 
the second time 
you've worked 
with five black guys. 
You know... 
I do a lot of gardening, 
but you are without a doubt 
the dirtiest, used up ho 
I have ever seen. 
Natasha, when a woman is 
as sexually active as you are, they have to take special care of their body. 
I've come up with a douche 
that no one has ever heard of, you know, 
like Chris D'Elia. 
And, Hannibal, all night, 
I've been trying to remember 
who you remind me of. 
Page 35/65
Then it hit me. 
You look just like 
that gingerbread man 
I left in the oven too long. 
Let's get to the reason 
I'm here tonight, 
which is to give Justin Bieber some tips to use 
when he inevitably 
ends up in prison. 
I've been in lockup, 
and you wouldn't last a week, 
so pay attention. 
The first thing you'll need 
is a shank. 
I made mine 
out of a pintail comb 
and a pack of gum. 
I'll show you how later. 
It's so simple. 
I found Bubblicious works best, and it's so much fun to say. 
You see, 
when I did my stretch, 
all the hood rats 
on my cellblock 
wanted to break off a piece 
of Martha Stewart's ass, 
so I decided some bitch 
needed to get got. 
I walked 
into the chow hall, 
picked out 
the biggest bull dyke, 
and I stuck her. 
From then on, 
prison was easier than making 
blueberry scones. 
[cheers and applause] 
And--[laughs] 
And Shaq-- 
Shaq, I hope your mom doesn't 
still hold a grudge. 
Justin, before I go, 
Page 36/65
here's my final piece of advice. You need to settle down, 
bring some balance 
into your life, 
find yourself the right gal, 
but she'll have to be someone 
on your level, 
someone powerful and famous 
and rich, 
someone you can smoke a joint 
with or indulge 
in the occasional three-way. 
I'm talking about a "playa" 
in the boardroom 
and a freak in the bedroom. 
So, Justin, my final piece 
of advice is call me, or-- 
[cheers and applause] 
Or not. 
I'm out, bitch. 
[techno music] 
[cheers and applause] 
(announcer) 
Still to come, Jeff Ross... 
Killer. 
The killer. 
(announcer) 
And Snoop Dogg. 
I'm going bodyguard hard, man. I ain't fixin' 
to play no games, man. 
(announcer) 
When The Roast 
of Justin Bieber continues. 
[techno music] 
All right. 
Martha Stewart, Goddamn. 
[cheers and applause] 
Our next roaster 
is Jeff Ross. 
Now... 
I actually gave Jeff a role 
in my movie The Wedding Ringer, and he doubled the budget 
Page 37/65
because he demanded 
to be paid in cake. 
Right now, I want everybody 
to pull out a bucket of fish 
for the roastmaster himself, 
Jeff Ross, everybody. 
[cheers and applause] 
How cool is this? 
Give it up for the Biebs, 
doing great so far. 
[cheers and applause] 
Fantastic. 
This is so fun. 
I never roasted somebody 
with a bedtime before. 
I got to give you props, 
asking us to roast you. 
Ballsy move, dude, 
especially since you haven't 
put out an album 
in three years. 
Come on, Biebs, what are you 
doing with your life? 
If you listen closely, 
you can hear the sound 
of One Direction 
fucking your fans. 
A lot of Beliebers 
are upset 
that Justin's 
never won a Grammy. 
Well, there's Martha Stewart. 
She can be your Grammy. 
Martha Stewart's here 
because Paula Deen 
refused to sit 
with this many black folk. 
What is this, the Comedy Central March on Ferguson? 
Martha, I want to fuck you 
so bad. 
I bet your pubic hair 
is 50 shades of gray. 
Martha went to prison 
Page 38/65
for dumping worthless stock 
for idiot consumers to buy, 
which reminds me, 
Ludacris' new album 
drops tomorrow. 
But enough about Ludacris, 
let's talk about "food-acris," Shaquille O'Neal. 
Shaq. 
[growls] 
[growls] 
Shaq. 
[growls] 
I like to talk to him 
in his native tongue. 
Shaq was the original 
2 Chainz, 
'cause that's how he was brought into this country. 
Shaq's dick is so big, 
he uses it as a selfie stick. 
Love you, Kev. 
You're doing 
a hell of a job 
as the host tonight, man. 
I really appreciate 
how funny you are. 
I really do. 
[cheers and applause] 
Kevin's a big star now, 
but he doesn't need private jets 'cause he likes to be 
shot out of a cannon. 
Kev, we've been friends 
a long time. 
I want to congratulate you. 
I hear your girlfriend recently got down on one knee 
so you could propose, and-- 
How do y'all make love, 
puppy style? 
Chris D'Elia's here. 
Chris, how you doing, man? 
Chris is here 
Page 39/65
because he's 
Justin Bieber's 
favorite comedian. 
Wow, what an endorsement. 
That's like being Shaq's 
favorite poet. 
[laughs] 
Snoop, love you, buddy. 
Love you, man, so much. 
You look like a retired 
WNBA player. 
The only person that's inhaled more smoke than Snoop 
is Pete Davidson's dad 
inside the World Trade Center. Thanks, Pete. 
I'm sorry, Shaq. 
I know that was your favorite 
building to climb. 
Shaq, [growls] 
Never forget. 
[growls] 
Oh, this is so much fun. 
I gotta give a shout-out to 
one of my favorite people ever, Dave Chappelle over there. 
What's up, dude? 
Don't be scared. 
Watching the roast. 
Super big comedy fan, 
my friend. 
[loud cheering] 
One of the greats. 
Love you, buddy. 
Thank you for flying in 
from South Africa 
to be with us tonight. 
Justin, I feel like 
I'm roasting you 
for the entire world tonight. 
The roast fans really 
want blood this time, 
even though 
most of your fans 
Page 40/65
haven't even gotten 
their periods yet. 
But if you can take a joke, 
then so can the Beliebers 
watching tonight, 
because face it, Biebs, 
you've become 
a cocky little shit. 
You are the King Joffrey 
of pop. 
[cheers and applause] 
What's your rap name, 
Feminem? 
Selena Gomez wanted to be here, but she's dating men now. 
Is it true you dumped her 
because she grew a moustache 
before you? 
That's right, Selena Gomez 
used to bang this guy, 
proving once again 
that Mexicans will do 
the disgusting jobs 
Americans just won't do. 
U-S-A! U-S-A! 
U-S-A! U-S-- 
Now there are rumors 
going around 
you might have been dating 
Kendall Jenner. 
Hi, Kendall. 
How you doing, doll? 
You having fun? 
That's good. 
What dating site did you two 
meet on, O-K Stupid? 
Anyway, Biebs, you have 
such a huge career behind you. But lately, a lot of people 
have been pointing 
their fingers at you, 
and those are just lesbians 
showing the barber 
how they want their hair cut. 
Page 41/65
Even when you went 
to Anne Frank's house, 
there were fans waiting 
for you outside. 
I wish they were 
the same people 
that were waiting 
for Anne Frank. 
Oh, come on! 
You said Anne Frank 
would've been a Bieblier. 
If Anne Frank 
heard your music, 
she would've Ubered 
to Auschwitz. 
And, Biebs, we've all seen 
your sexy underwear commercials, and don't worry, 
you're not the first youngster to have Calvin Klein 
wedged in your asshole. 
But you know what? 
The best part 
about taking Justin from behind is that you can shave 
half his head 
and pretend 
it's Miley Cyrus. 
You like that one? 
Justin's ass 
is like a movie ticket, 
'cause it was ripped apart 
by an "usher." 
[audience groans] 
And as you sat here 
taking it like a man tonight, 
you were probably thinking 
that none of us know 
what we're talking about, 
'cause you're gonna fly 
out of here on a private jet 
full of cash and models, 
and we'll all be trying 
to finger-bang Martha Stewart 
Page 42/65
at the afterparty. 
And you know what, Biebs, 
you're right. 
You're young, you're talented, you're famous, 
and that can be 
a lot of pressure, 
but you're a smart man 
with a good heart, 
and I know 
you'll never end up 
like Kurt Cobain 
or Amy Winehouse... 
respected. 
Happy birthday, buddy. 
[techno music] 
Good show, buddy. 
(announcer) 
Coming up...Snoop Dogg... 
- Hannibal Buress. 
- I hate everybody. 
(announcer) 
And Justin Bieber 
when the Comedy Central Roast 
of Justin Bieber continues. 
[techno music] 
[cheers and applause] 
Are we having a good time 
tonight? Yes? 
[cheers and applause] 
Our next roaster is Snoop. 
Yeah, he's here. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
You know, Snoop used to 
call himself the "D-O-double-G." That's right, The Dogg. 
Right, Snoop? 
Back in the day, the reason why he called himself The Dogg. 
is because he was a dog 
with the ladies. 
It's true. 
Now he's called The Dogg 
Page 43/65
because he sleeps all day 
in a sun spot 
on the living room floor. 
Isn't that true? 
That's true, Snoop. 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
make some noise 
for Snoop Dogg right now. 
[Snoop Dogg's Peaches 'N Cream] That's that look 
all on her face 
Shorty dancing like she knows 
She's the baddest in the place Kevin, you look good 
tonight, dog. 
Some real shit, nephew. 
You look real good. 
I didn't know 
the Muppets made 
motherfucking clothes 
for a nigger though. 
Yes, sir. 
Now, look, 
Kevin's from Philadelphia, 
right, just like Bill Cosby. 
And just like Bill Cosby, 
women can't tell 
when Kevin's inside of them. 
[crowd groans] 
Yeah. 
I don't need no warm-up. 
I've been smoking and drinking. I feel real good about myself. [cheers and applause] 
Yes, sir. 
Now, check this out, I done 
a whole bunch of roasts, right, but they never let a real player on stage with me until tonight. We got Ludacris 
in the motherfucking house. 
Luda. 
Luda! 
I love that song of yours 
Page 44/65
where you said, 
If you a pimp and you know it 
You don't love them hos 
That shit was tight. 
But you know who else said 
that that was tight? 
Me, 15 years 
before you did it, 
nigger, 
stop biting my shit. 
But here's one of Ludacris' 
original rhymes. 
"There's hos in the room. 
There's hos in the car. 
There's hos on the stage. 
There's hos by the bar." 
Nigger, are you a rapper 
or Dr. Seuss? 
Now, this little bitty 
fine little... 
Natasha Leggero. 
Is that how you say it, 
"Leg-gero"? 
- No, but that's okay. 
- Le-ghetto. 
That's how we say it. 
I seen how you was looking at me though, right? 
What I want to know is 
have you ever sucked 
a black dick before? 
Hey, I'm going off script 
right now. 
I just really want to know. 
Hey. 
Hey, something 
about this pimping, man. 
You understand me? 
When I'm pimping, man, 
that shit just go 
every direction. 
But let me talk about my homeboy right here, Shaquille O'Neal. 
Shaq Daddy. 
Page 45/65
I always say that Shaq is 
the greatest Laker of all time, unless I'm chilling 
with Kobe Bryant. 
Ohhh! 
Y'all got to excuse my little 
retarded cousin right there. 
Somebody get 
his little helmet 
and get that little yellow bus around the side. 
Hannibal Buress. 
You the only Bill Cosby accuser making money off of it. 
Now, Jeff Ross, 
check this out, Jeff. 
Now, see, Jeff is what you call a throwback, 
because his face looks 
like something 
that you could have 
a hook in it. 
That's right, 
that's a fishing joke. 
I fish, motherfucker. 
[cheers and applause] 
Yeah, dog! 
Now that I've done said 
what I needed to say 
about all the rest of these hos and bitches up on the stage, 
it's time to talk 
about the bitch of the hour, 
Justin "Leave it to" Bieber. 
[cheers and applause] 
Justin's life changed when Usher heard one of his songs 
and liked it, 
which only goes to prove 
that Usher ain't black. 
Now, Justin, you released 
so many horrible 
and unwatchable videos, 
you should change your name 
Page 46/65
to Vanilla ISIS. 
[crowd groans] 
No, no, no. 
Real shit though. 
- Oh, shit. 
- Real shit. 
This is my nigger 
right here, nigger. 
Hold on, nigger, 
this my nigger. 
Nigger, this my nigger. 
Nigger, 
you had your shot, nigger. 
This is my nigger 
right here, nigger. 
Nigger. 
Goddamn, nigger, nigger, 
nigger, nigger, nigger. 
Now, most niggers, 
like myself, 
we go a little crazy 
when we get famous. 
Buy some dope cars, 
fuck some bad bitches, 
but, nigger, 
you bought a monkey. 
I mean, that monkey 
was more embarrassed 
than the one that started 
the AIDS epidemic. 
Now, when J-Bird 
got arrested, 
he had a big smile 
in his mug shot. 
Not because he gangster, because he knows what goes on in jail. Now, Justin, 
you so motherfucking pretty, 
when the inmates 
saw your mug shot, 
they swiped right. 
Let me say this 
to you, J.B. 
Justin Bieber, D-M-B, 
Page 47/65

"damn near black." 
Now see, black people, we 
normally hate when white people try to steal our culture 
and be like us, 
minus the discrimination, 
police brutality, 
and the marching and shit. 
That was until Justin Bieber 
came along. 
We don't mind him 
smoking weed in public 
while sagging in the club, 
pissing in the mop bucket, 
drunk driving, 
living in a mansion 
while playing loud music 
and hating the neighbors 
for not welcoming change. 
Welcome to the family, 
my nigger. 
[cheers and applause] 
She 'bout to go in 
She likes that low end 
Damn, her ass is so big 
That was Snoop Dogg, 
everybody. 
I just want to--You know, I just want to take a second right now to speak on behalf 
of all the black people. 
I don't--I don't know 
how many niggers 
we were allowed to say 
in this show, 
but I think--I definitely 
think Snoop used them all. 
Like, we're done. 
Like, we're done. 
Like, dude, we had, like, ten. They gave us ten. 
You used them all, 
and then you blamed us. 
You was like, "Yo, they got us Page 48/65

drinking and smoking." 
No, we don't. 
That's you. 
It's just you. 
You. 
You did that. 
Don't do that to us. 
I want Snoop removed. 
Like, if this was the block, 
I would snitch. 
It was him. 
He did it. 
He said we all doing drugs. 
We drinking and smoking 
back there. 
No, we're not. 
It's just you! 
Fuck you. 
Fuck you, Snoop. 
I didn't do nothing. 
You tried to ruin me tonight, 
you son of a bitch. 
You tried to--You tried to make it a group black thing. 
That's what you tried to do. 
"All us niggers 
up here." 
No, it's not. 
No, it's not. 
[techno music] 
She's worried 
about her lipstick. 
- Let me-- 
- Shut up. 
- Let me check it out for her. - [laughing] 
(announcer) 
Still to come: 
and Hannibal Buress. 
You're getting it. 
Brrr! 
(announcer) 
When the Comedy Central Roast 
Page 49/65
of Justin Bieber continues. 
This is something 
that I really enjoy, 
and I want to be 
invited back. 
I love the roasts. 
- Yeah! 
[techno music] 
Hannibal Buress is up next, 
ladies and gentlemen. 
I'm a fan. 
I love Hannibal. 
I really do. 
We know why he's here, 
okay, 
'cause he's not happy just 
destroying my childhood hero. 
That's not--that doesn't 
make him feel good enough. 
No, no, no. 
He's here to destroy my 
daughter's childhood hero 
as well. 
I want you guys to please 
welcome the man who's so slow 
and drowsy that you think that Bill Cosby drugged him. 
I'm talking about Hannibal 
Buress, ladies and gentlemen. 
Hannibal Buress. 
[hip-hop music] 
What's up? 
Hello. 
Kevin Hart, everybody. 
Kevin Hart. 
Congrats on all your success, 
Kevin. 
I'm sure it's gonna last 
forever. 
It's amazing to have Kevin Hart and Shaq here. 
Is this a roast or is this Tyler Perry's Of Mice and Men? 
Shaq's a very unique player 
Page 50/65
in NBA history. 
He's the first player in NBA 
history to have his shoe size, IQ, and jersey all be 
the same number. 
Shaq is a police officer 
in Florida. 
If you want to escape from Shaq, just jog slowly away from him 
'cause that's-- 
And he'll fall eventually. 
Snoop is here. 
Snoop Dogg. 
Snoop D-O-double-G. 
Snoop is like a cool-ass 
salamander. 
Snoop's like a rejected 
Mortal Kombat boss. 
"Now you have to fight 
fake Crip." 
Snoop is good at social media, but he's bad at music now. 
Snoop, the only way you'll get another hit is if you stand 
behind Suge Knight's car 
in a parking lot. 
Chris--I don't know if 
you know this about Chris. 
He doesn't smoke weed. 
He doesn't drink. 
He's never done any drugs. 
His only vice is performing 
horrible standup comedy 
all around the country. 
Speaking of horrible comics, 
Jeff Ross is here. 
Jeff Ross. 
Jeff, you look horrible. 
Jeff looks like a combination of every "before" picture ever. 
Jeff only does roasts. 
Congratulations on being the 
only person on this stage 
that's making 95% 
Page 51/65
of your yearly income today. 
It's good to see Comedy Central diversifying its talent 
with whatever race 
Pete Davidson is. 
You just look real-- 
You're just real vague, man. 
You have a weird, vague-ass 
face, and I don't like it. 
I don't like 
your face at all, man. 
You seem like a nice person, 
but when I talk to you, 
I don't have fun. 
Pete. 
Pete has got a lot going on. 
Pete, I don't know how you can juggle SNL, standup, 
and Lorne Michaels' balls 
in your mouth 
all at the same time. 
An amazing multi-tasker 
Pete Davidson is. 
Natasha Leggero is here 
which means that right now 
there's a bachelor party 
discovering 
that their cake is empty. 
I'm not saying that 
Natasha's a whore, 
but I'm saying that Shaq can fit both feet in her pussy. 
And now the man of the hour. 
Justin Bieber, 
you dainty wigger, you. 
Justin Bieber. 
They say that you roast 
the ones you love, but I don't like you at all, man. 
I'm just here 'cause this is 
a real good opportunity for me. Justin, oh, you gotta 
give it up for Justin. 
He started from the bottom, 
Page 52/65
and he's still a bottom. 
I don't like your music, man. 
I'm not a big fan of it. 
I listened to some of it. 
I'm not a fan. 
I don't like your music. 
I think it's bad. 
I think it's bad, man. 
I don't like it. 
I hate your music, man. 
I hate your music more than 
Bill Cosby hates my comedy. 
Yo, Justin, man. 
Well, this has been cool, 
and despite 
all those foul things I said, 
you seem like 
a sharp businessman, 
and, uh... 
this is real cool 
that you did this 
and let all these strangers 
shit on you 
in front of all these 
people, 
and I actually like 
that song Confident. 
That's a good song. 
I like that song. 
So thanks for letting me do it, and congratulations, man. 
All right, later, y'all. 
Hannibal just killed me. 
(announcer) 
Up next,... 
Ahh! 
Catch me, Kevin! 
(announcer) 
Justin Bieber gets revenge... 
Let's do this. 
- Everybody in here? 
- I'm not in it. 
[techno music] 
All right. 
Page 53/65
Ladies and gentlemen, 
I would give an introduction, 
but I don't need to. 
Ron Burgundy. 
[cheers and applause] 
Listen, people. 
Listen, listen. 
I don't have a lot of time, 
all right? 
I don't have a lot of time. 
I'm currently over at 
stage 24 
hosting Spike TV's 
"Your Mother's a Fat Bitch" 
awards show. 
Some real clever writing, 
great energy over there. 
Boy, have we got a great gang of talented comics here tonight. 
We've got Tom Dreesen, 
Willie Tyler, and Lester. 
I didn't realize Lester 
was a live human being. 
Gary Mule Deer, 
Fannie Flagg, 
top notch. 
Star-studded evening. 
Listen, I'm just gonna cut 
to the chase. 
Justin Biber--Justin Bieber, 
you've been taking it 
on the chin tonight. 
You really have. 
In fact, absolutely abused, 
and I'm just here 
to say one thing. 
You people don't know what 
the hell you're talking about. As far as I'm concerned, 
this guy is doing it right. 
Here's a couple things I know. September 1st, 2014, Bieber 
arrested for a collision with 
a minivan in his hometown 
Page 54/65
of Stratford, Ontario, Canada, and then beat up 
the occupant of the minivan. 
Nice work! 
October 18th, 2010, 
Bieber accused of assaulting 
a 12-year-old 
at a laser tag arena. 
Kaboom! 
I only wish the kid was 
a nine-year-old. 
March 28th, 2013, 
Bieber flies into Munich 
with his pet monkey, Mally, 
doesn't have the proper 
paperwork, 
so he leaves it at a zoo 
in Germany. 
It's a monkey. 
It's named Mally. 
Don't think twice-- 
you leave it at a German zoo. 
March 4th, 2013, two hours late to a concert in Dubai 
because he refused to stop 
playing a video game. 
Say what? 
Hocked a loogie 
at his neighbor 
after the guy complained that 
Bieber was driving 100 mph 
in his gated community 
neighborhood. 
Eat that, bitch! 
July 10th, 2013, Bieber pees 
in a restaurant mop bucket. 
As he runs off, he sprays 
a photograph of Bill Clinton 
with a bottle of blue liquid 
and yells, 
"Fuck Bill Clinton!" 
There's not a person in 
this room who hasn't done that, you hypocritical assholes. 
Page 55/65
This kid has spunk, 
moxie, 
and probably 
a few other STDs, okay? 
I've always encouraged people 
to stay classy, 
and what's more classy 
than hanging out 
with Floyd Mayweather? 
Would I love to see Biebs 
spending time 
with Oscar Pistorius? 
Of course I would, 
but that day will come. 
People refer to 
Mr. Bieber as a kid or a boy, 
but here's a newsflash, gang. 
He's a man, 
a full-grown man 
who works and loves 
and makes things 
with his hands, 
a man who sings songs 
for nine-year-olds 
and cuts his hair 
like a gay figure skater. 
This guy just continues 
to impress. 
Is there anything 
he can't do? 
In fact, 
I pulled my pants down 
and took a big, creamy shit 
in the green room 
because I thought to myself, 
"That's how the Biebs 
would do it. 
Again and again 
and again." 
If anything, 
Justin Bieber, 
not only do you need 
to continue to live your life 
with the same 
Page 56/65
reckless abandon, 
I suggest you 
turn up the heat. 
Oh, and one last thing, 
if you're watching 
from your monkey cage 
in Germany... 
Go to bed, Mally. 
Good night. 
[pop music] 
(announcer) 
Up next: 
There he is! 
Justin Bieber. 
That's the guy 
you want. 
Wow. 
You know what? 
Right now it's finally time 
to bring up 
the boy of the hour. 
You, Justin Bieber, 
it's time, man. 
Here's what I want to say. 
At 21, he's already the most 
famous living celebrity 
in the world. 
It's true. 
He has over 60 million followers on Twitter. 
He's at 40 million on Grindr. 
It's true. 
It's true. 
It's weird, but it's true. 
They love you, Justin. 
He's a platinum-selling 
recording artist, okay? 
Justin Bieber has 
the voice of an angel, 
and he has the haircut and 
tattoos of a lesbian butcher. 
This shit is bad. 
It's bad. 
Page 57/65
I don't like it, but I love him, so I can't tell him. 
You guys do it. 
Write a letter. 
It's fucked up. 
It's fucked up, man. 
Him and Snoop are in 
the same position. 
Nobody wants to say anything. 
Look at Snoop's look. 
It's like a teenage boy 
in high school, but he grew up, but he didn't graduate, 
but he's in college. 
What the fuck 
are you doing? 
Why does Snoop have on Chucks? It makes me so mad. 
I hate it. 
I hate it. 
What the fuck 
are you doing? 
Let it go. 
Your kids are in college. 
What 70-year-old nigger 
is doing this? 
I hate it. 
Justin, that's where 
you're headed. 
It's right in front 
of your face. 
Look at old success. 
Shaq has on a tie 
with glitter, 
and what the fuck 
are you doing? 
Like, I don't even know 
what it is. 
- Diamonds. 
- Shaq, it's not diamonds. 
It's graffiti. 
You're stupid. 
I hate it. 
I hate my people, man. 
Page 58/65
I really do. 
You know, I would say something about you, Jeff, 
but this is all you got. 
I don't want to fuck this 
up for you. 
Every year you're back here. 
This is it. 
You're you, okay? 
That's what you say to people 
that you know not gonna make it. You're you. 
Right now, you know what? 
It's about the guy 
that we came to roast tonight, and I can be honored to say 
I'm a fucking fan. 
Not only am I a fan, 
I'm a friend. 
I'm glad to be here tonight, 
Justin, and I think 
everybody else up here tonight can say the same thing. 
With that being said, 
please make some noise 
and welcome Justin Bieber, 
ladies and gentlemen. 
- I need somebody to love 
Do-do-do 
Oh, I don't need too much 
Just somebody to love 
Somebody to love 
I don't need nothing else 
I promise, girl, I swear 
I just need somebody to love 
Damn, you guys were brutal. 
Goodness gracious. 
This was supposed to be 
a birthday present. 
When I tell people what I got 
for my 21st birthday, 
I get to tell them 
that I got my dick kicked in. 
I know I've been 
Page 59/65
driving recklessly, 
getting arrested, 
smoking weed, 
abandoning monkeys, 
and urinating publicly, 
but my biggest regret 
is plowing my Maserati 
into Jeff Ross's Saturn 
in the parking lot, man. 
And, Jeff, 
I feel really bad 
because I don't know 
where you're gonna sleep 
tonight, man. 
Look, I'm new to comedy, 
but here's a joke, all right? 
What do you get when you give 
a teenager $200 million? 
A bunch of has-beens calling you a lesbian for two hours. 
[laughter and applause] 
All right, all right. 
I'm playing. 
You guys were all 
really funny tonight. 
When we were looking 
for a roastmaster, 
we called Jamie Foxx, 
Chris Rock, 
and they both 
couldn't do it. 
Then I had a great idea. 
Let's call Kevin Hart 
and see if he has 
Dave Chappelle's number. 
No, I have hu-- 
[inaudible] 
- [indistinct] 
- He didn't have it. 
He didn't have it. 
(Justin) 
Kevin, you were awesome tonight. I have huge respect 
for Kevin Hart. 
Page 60/65
Kevin loves seeing himself 
on the big screen. 
And for him that's an iPad mini. Sorry. 
Kevin is so short, 
he calls Lil Wayne "Wayne." 
I love Kevin Hart's 
career plan. 
Do everything Martin Lawrence 
did, only shittier. 
And, Martha, 
thanks for coming. 
I know that's probably something you don't do much of anymore. 
Ah, Natasha Leggero, 
this is my first time 
seeing you perform. 
You were really great 
even though you didn't shoot out a single ping pong ball 
like Snoop promised. 
And, Jeff Ross, 
thanks for being here, man. 
Jeff, you look like 
the emoji you send 
when you want to tell someone 
you have food poisoning. 
Oh. 
Chris D'Elia is 
my favorite comedian, 
and I'm lucky to call him 
a friend. 
Chris actually 
brought me on stage 
at one of his shows, 
and it was really cool. 
It was the first time 
I got to see what it was like 
to perform for eight people 
staring at their phones. 
I'm a huge fan 
of Chris D'Elia. 
Chris gets a ton of girls. 
You want to know why? 
Page 61/65
'Cause I'm a big fan 
of Chris D'Elia. 
That's right. 
That's what I get. 
Love you. 
Luda, what's up, man? 
I knew you would show up 
for me tonight. 
I feel like I've known you 
my whole life, 
but that's just because 
you look like 
the Mr. Potato Head 
I had as a kid. 
- Luda and I had-- 
- [laughing] 
That's good. 
That's good. 
Luda and I had a lot of hours 
making the song Baby together. In fact, he told me 
it was the only baby 
he ever made on purpose. 
Of course I had to have 
one of my favorite people 
in the world here tonight, 
Shaquille O'Neal. 
Thanks for coming, man. 
I love you, dude, 
but how in 19 seasons 
have you only made 
one three-pointer? 
I've hit more pedestrians 
with my car. 
And Hannibal Buress, thank you so much for being here. 
I don't really know much 
about you, 
but from what 
I've been hearing, 
I hope you don't know much 
about me either. 
Snoop Doggie Dogg, 
what's up, man? 
Page 62/65
He's way too shy to admit this, but he was actually 
the Billboard top male artist 
the year I was born. 
And look at you now, Snoop. 
You're one of 
the ten dudes at my roast 
sitting right next to 
Martha Stewart 
and that Hannibal guy. 
How cool is this? 
So cool. 
You made it. 
I'm proud of you, man. 
I'm proud of you. 
Before I go, I want to thank 
everyone for tonight. 
This roast was 
a dream of mine. 
I especially want to thank 
all my fans, the dais, 
and everyone 
watching at home. 
I turned a lot of people off 
over the past few years, 
but I know I can still 
turn out good music 
and turn everything all around. You have my word. 
I will not end up broken, 
pathetic, bitter, 
or sitting on the dais 
of somebody else's roast. 
No, but seriously. 
Really, let's get serious 
for a second. 
There was really no preparing me for this life. 
I was thrown into this 
at 12 years old, 
and I didn't really know what 
I was getting myself into. 
There's been moments 
I'm really proud of, 
Page 63/65
and a lot of moments 
I look back 
and I'm pretty disappointed 
in myself for, 
but the things that I've done 
really don't define who I am. 
I'm a kindhearted person 
who loves people, 
and through it all I lost 
some of my best qualities. 
For that, I'm sorry. 
But what I can say is I'm 
looking forward to being someone that you guys can all look at 
and be proud of, 
someone you can smile at 
and see some of yourself in. 
Someone close to me 
once said, 
"It's how you rise 
from a fall 
that truly defines you 
as a man." 
I'm excited 
for that challenge, 
and I want to say 
thank you so much 
for taking this journey 
with me, 
and I'm excited for you 
to see what's next. 
Thank you, God, 
for your grace 
and for never 
giving up on me. 
[cheers and applause] 
But one more thing. 
One more thing before I go. 
There's someone in my life who I owe a special apology to. 
I'm talking about someone 
who I really loved 
and lost because 
I screwed it all up, 
Page 64/65
but thankfully 
that special someone, 
the love of my life, 
is here tonight. 
I just want that second chance, so if you could come on out. 
This is your monkey. 
I missed you, buddy. 
Want to go to the zoo? 
I'm just kidding. 
Thank you so much 
and good night. 
You did good, man. 
I'm proud of you, buddy. 
Incredible fucking show. 
[techno music] 
It takes a lot of balls 
to do that. 
I wouldn't be able 
to do that. 
Happy to do it. 
Great, dude. 
It really was. 
- It was really great. 
- That's my guy, right?

Comedy Central Roast of Donald Trump 
Page 1/47
1 
All aboard! 
We are high priests. Warlocks. We're Vatican assassins. 
This rock star 
must make them weep. 
I'm an f-18, bro. 
I'm going off the rails 
on a crazy train 
I'm going off the rails 
on a crazy train 
This is the Comedy Central 
Roast of Charlie Sheen, 
brought to you 
by Axe body spray 
and FIFA Soccer 12. 
And now, please welcome 
your roastmaster, 
Seth MacFarlane. s
Ladies and gentlemen... 
Thank you. 
Thank you very much. 
Good evening, 
ladies and gentlemen. 
I'm Seth MacFarlane, 
and, yes, the big night 
is finally here. 
Welcome to the Comedy Central 
Roast of Charlie Sheen. 
Yes, we're here tonight 
to honor and hopefully arrest 
a man who was great 
in two things 25 years ago, 
Charlie Sheen. 
Actually, 
there's a lot of Sheen on TV 
this evening 
when this show airs. 
Tonight on Two and a Half Men, they're actually having 
Charlie's pretend funeral, 
believe it or not. 
There's no need 
to switch over, though. 
Page 2/47
Just wait a few months. 
You can probably 
see the real thing. 
I mean, we all know 
there's a good chance 
Charlie will be dead soon, 
so I wrote an o-- 
an obituary. 
"Charlie Sheen, 
who became a tabloid fixture 
"due to his problems 
with drugs and alcohol, 
was found dead 
in his apartment--" 
Actually, you know what? 
I kind of actually just copied Amy Winehouse's obituary. 
It's--it's--I only had 
to change three things, though. The sex of the deceased, 
the location of the body, 
and the part that says, 
"a talent that will be missed." We love Charlie! 
All right. 
So I know Tyson's 
not gonna kick 
the shit out of me. 
That's good news. 
So we're gonna take a few pokes at him here tonight, 
but there is no denying 
that Charlie Sheen is an icon. You've seen him on TV. 
You've seen him in movies. 
And if you're a prostitute, 
you've seen him point 
a gun at your face 
while you try to get him hard. Let's take a look back 
at the work 
that paid for all that cocaine. Gentlemen... 
He's back. 
Page 3/47
Hey, buddy. 
And they're off and running. 
Now cool off. 
Oh, I am cool. 
You should see me when I'm hot. What are you looking at? 
What are you smiling at, huh? 
How many yachts 
can you water-ski behind? 
How much is enough? 
- I am your daughter. 
- No, you're not. 
- Aah! 
- Gah! 
Are too, too, too, too, too... Not, not, not, not, not, not... "Are too" times ten. 
Tiger blood. 
Yes, it's real. 
It's as real as me. 
It's the eye of the tiger 
it's the thrill 
of the fight 
rising up to the challenge 
of our rivals 
We got warrants! 
We're the law! 
- Golf clap? 
- Golf clap. 
And he's watching us 
all with the eye 
of the tiger 
Some are saying 
that you're bipolar. 
I'm bi-winning. 
Winning! 
Charlie Sheen has got 
to be on drugs again. 
- Sure. 
- Drugs? 
I am on a drug. 
It's called Charlie Sheen. 
Reminder-- 
tiger blood. 
Page 4/47
With a shot 
of tiger blood... 
Winner, winner, chicken 
dinner--I don't think so. 
Winner, winner, Sheen dinner! 
Winning. 
Pretty [bleep] cool, huh? 
Due to pending legal action, 
we are unable 
to show you a scene 
from Two and a Half Men 
at this time. 
Strike this mother[bleep] out. Wild thing delivers. 
Wild thing 
you make my heart sing 
You are the sexiest man 
I have ever laid eyes on. 
Check. 
Come on, come on, 
wild thing 
You know, I've lived 
a pretty wild life, 
with the drinking 
and the hookers and the drugs 
and the hookers. 
Ugh. 
You're such a pig. 
You know, usually 
I have to date a woman 
before she treats me this way. There's my life. 
Deal with it. 
It's on. Bring it. 
Winning. Buh-bye. 
And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's time to bring out 
the man of the hour. 
He went from 
Ferris Bueller's Day Off 
to having every day off. 
Please welcome 
the rock star from Mars, 
Charlie Sheen. 
Page 5/47
Wow. Wow! 
Wow! Wow! 
Wow. 
Wow, wow, wow. 
Wow. 
Unbelievable. 
Thank you. Thank you. 
Have fun. 
Slash! 
- How are you, Seth? 
- Charlie. 
Ahh. 
Thank you. 
There he sits, 
the man of the hour. 
Charlie, you claim 
to have tiger blood, 
but with all the porn stars 
you've banged, 
it's probably just 
Tiger Woods' blood, 
I'm guessing. 
You have a lot of nicknames 
for yourself. 
You say you're 
a Vatican assassin, 
whatever that is. 
Charlie, the Vatican 
does not have assassins. 
No. 
If they want 
to shut someone up, 
they just buy 'em ice cream 
and tell 'em if they talk, 
Jesus will kill their parents. Now, as you may know, 
Charlie Sheen 
is not his birth name. 
His original Spanish name 
is seor drugs. 
Kidding aside, though, 
Carlos Estevez 
took his dad's name, 
yes, to gain credibility 
Page 6/47
as an actor. 
I've seen your films, 
and you don't really act 
like a Sheen. 
But, you know, 
with your rap sheet 
and briefcases of coke, 
you're definitely 
acting like a Carlos. 
Charlie went on 
to star in TV and film, 
both drama and comedy. 
He was the star of Hot Shots... Which is also 
what Charlie feels 
when he takes a piss. 
I really think you 
and Emilio should do a follow-up to the movie Men at Work, 
and you can call it 
"Men Who Don't Work Anymore." 
Right? 
That would be... 
I'll help-- 
I'll help you write that. 
But, uh, of course 
a very public meltdown 
changed the landscape. 
It's interesting, 
when you think about 
the firing of Charlie Sheen 
tells you all you really 
need to know about Hollywood. 
You can abuse drugs. 
You can abuse your spouse. 
You can trash hotel rooms. 
You can solicit prostitutes. 
But don't you ever, ever 
call a Jewish guy 
by his actual Jewish name. 
So, now Charlie 
is a self-contained unit. 
He is dependent upon no man 
and no thing... 
Page 7/47
Except crack, jack, crank, 
meth, ludes, 
Vicodin, blow, acid, 
uppers, poppers, 
"E," nitrous, dust, hash, 
and this one boner medicine 
from Norway. 
He's the reason 
a dick with cocaine on it 
is called a "sheenis." 
Wow. 
Wow. 
He's still with us, 
Charlie Sheen. 
In fact, Charlie just celebrated his 46th birthday... 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
A statement no one thought 
we would ever hear-- 
kind of like, 
"Get Jeselnik on the phone." 
Or... 
Or "Jeff Ross'll pay for it." 
Or Jon Lovitz saying, 
"one [bleep] at a time, please." Charlie allegedly 
made a prostitute cry 
at the Plaza hotel. 
I want to tell you though, 
Charlie, I think she's lying. 
'Cause I saw the scene 
where you got arrested 
in Wall Street. 
You can't even 
make yourself cry. 
But, you know, with all those 
"Dangerous Jobs" shows on TV, 
like the ones about crab 
fishing, ice-road trucking, 
why is there no show 
about the most dangerous 
job out there-- 
Being an escort 
Page 8/47
for Charlie Sheen? 
How long must we wait 
for the first season 
of Deadliest Snatch? 
I'm ready to see that right-- 
right now. 
Honestly, Charlie, 
I never thought 
I would live to see the night 
that you would live 
to see this night. 
I really didn't. 
And now our first roaster, 
Jon Lovitz. 
He was one of the stars 
of a Saturday Night Live cast 
that the critics have hailed 
as "not the worst." 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
please welcome the star 
of "Two and a Half Chins," 
one of my favorite 
SNL comics ever, 
Jon Lovitz. 
Thank you for that 
introduction, Seth MacFarlane. Anyway, I am Jon Lovitz, 
although I think most of you 
know me by my stage name-- 
J-Lo. 
Thank you. 
Well, look at this dais. 
Mike Tyson is here. 
Yes, sir. 
You know, his boxing nickname 
is iron Mike, 
which is what the guards 
used to scream at him 
in the prison laundry. 
I don't do that anymore, Jon. 
Well, I know 
you don't do that anymore. 
You're not in prison anymore. 
Just making it clear. 
Page 9/47
He's funny. 
Hey, how did Amy Schumer 
get here? 
I'd ask whose [bleep] 
she sucked to get on the dais, but she's dating 
Anthony Jeselnik, 
so I'll just ask him. 
Anthony, whose [bleep] did 
Amy suck to get on the dais? 
Who else is-- 
Oh, hello, Steve-O. 
Yes, sir. 
Talked to Steve-O this morning. I said, 
"How's your day going?" 
He said, "Great. 
I woke up, took a big shit, 
then got out of bed... 
You know, unlike all 
you people on this dais, 
I, uh-- 
I actually know Charlie, 
and I'm famous. 
No, he's my friend. 
I've known him 
for about 18 years, 
and I can tell you he's nothing like the character 
he plays on TMZ. 
And people say, 
"Oh, he's crazy," 
you know, just because he likes beautiful women 
to come to his house, have sex with him, and then leave. 
What a nut. 
First time I hung out 
with Charlie 
was at his house 
after the super bowl. 
Bunch of hot chicks 
showed up, and... 
I looked up, I saw 
Page 10/47
my old girlfriend, and... 
Charlie put his arm around me 
and said, "Pick a hooker." 
First time in my life I cried 
and came at the same time. 
No, it wasn't. 
And now a joke. 
How much blow 
can Charlie Sheen do? 
Enough to kill 
Two and a Half Men. 
I'm kidding. 
The man is misunderstood. 
Eight-balls of hern-- 
bad for you? 
Or as Charlie sees it, 
the most important 
meal of the day. 
Now, sure, things 
got pretty crazy for a while. 
He was all mixed up. 
But he knew it was time 
to get straight 
when he put 
his dick in his coke 
and his razor in his hooker. 
And did you know Charlie's-- 
according to the Torah, 
he's Jewish? 
And not because 
his mother's a Jew, 
but because CBS paid him 
$50 million 
and he still sued the network. Now, listen, 
despite what you read, 
Charlie's still close 
to all of his exes. 
Why, well, just recently, 
he took Brooke Mueller 
to Mexico... 
Where he banged her ass so hard three balloons of coke 
fell out. 
Page 11/47
But Charlie's a gentleman. 
He put them back in. 
Picture it! 
Thank you. 
Coming up, Kate Walsh... 
Oh, Charlie, wait till you see what the doctor's got in order. Mike Tyson, Amy Schumer, 
Jeff Ross... 
The real Gaddafi 
is hiding in Charlie Sheen's 
nostrils right now. 
- Steve-O. 
- Yeah. 
Anthony Jeselnik... 
[Bleep] off. 
William Shatner, 
Patrice O'Neal, 
and Charlie Sheen. 
Charlie, as you put it best, 
it's just words. 
All right. 
Our next roaster is Kate Walsh. Why are you here? 
Let me say that it is a thrill to be around the hottest, 
sexiest woman of 2002. 
Let's give a big round 
of meno-plause 
for the beautiful 
and talented Kate Walsh. 
Seth MacFarlane, 
the only difference between you and the hooker Charlie 
locked in the closet 
is that the hooker 
eventually came out. 
After years of playing 
a doctor on Grey's Anatomy 
and Private Practice, 
people actually think 
I'm a real doctor, 
so I figured, "[Bleep] it. 
"I'm gonna start giving 
Page 12/47
some professional diagnoses 
to these people over here." 
For instance, Jeff Ross, 
your results have come back, 
and I'm going 
to tell you something 
that you have never heard 
about any of your TV pilots. 
You tested positive. 
Congratulations, Jeff. 
And, Jeff, listen, 
I know you're concerned 
about your complexion, 
but you have to stop 
letting Mike Tyson 
[bleep] all over your face. 
He looks good. 
I like the way he looks. 
Thank you very much. 
Anthony Jeselnik, 
I don't normally do this, 
but I have to break 
doctor-patient confidentiality. Your results came back, 
and it turns out that 
that embarrassing, 
nasty parasite on your penis 
is Amy Schumer. 
And there is no cure. 
I'm so, so happy to see 
that William Shatner is here, 
because a medical colleague 
told me that you passed on. 
I said, "Bullshit. 
Have seen his resume? 
Shatner's never 
passed on anything." 
Just wait. 
You look great. 
I mean, your skin is so tight. I can't tell 
if you've had a face-lift 
or vaginal rejuvenation. 
Patrice O'Neal, 
Page 13/47
I understand you have diabetes, and as you know, 
this disease is very serious 
and often linked to a poor diet. So my advice is simple. 
Grape soda does not count 
as a fruit. 
Mr. Sheen, 
the doctor will see you now. 
I have to say, Charlie, 
you are an incredible 
medical specimen. 
I guess that's 
one of the benefits 
of waking up every morning 
at the crack of crack. 
And, you know, it's amazing. 
Despite all those years 
of abusing your lungs, 
your kidneys, your liver, 
the only thing you've had 
removed is your kids. 
Admittedly, Charlie gets 
a little confused sometimes. 
He's the only guy 
who pulls a knife 
on a woman who's already 
willing to [bleep] him. 
I'll drink to that. 
I'll drink to that. 
Michael, drink to that. 
But is Charlie really 
the worst guy here? 
So he made a chick 
blow him for 30 grand. 
Mike Tyson makes you blow him 
"'Cause I said so. That's why." I'll drink to that, too. 
I'll drink... 
Isn't that right, 
Steve-O? 
And so, Charlie, 
I'm happy to say, 
whether it's your Adonis DNA, 
Page 14/47
your tiger blood, 
or the drug 
called Charlie Sheen, 
for some reason, you're able 
to defy science and medicine 
and continue to survive. 
I'll pencil you in 
for your relapse next week. 
Thank you so much. 
Good night. 
Still to come, Jeff Ross... 
I wanted to dress like 
the world's biggest dictator 
to roast the world's 
biggest dick. 
Steve-O... 
Just a bunch a people 
having a great time 
- being mean to each other. 
- And Mike Tyson. 
Charlie, um, enjoy a night 
of some serious "bambargment." And I'm gonna rip you 
a new asshole. 
And, um, I still love you-- 
no hard feelings. 
All right. 
Here comes Jeff Ross... 
Who actually toured 
with Charlie. 
You know, I always thought 
Jeff was a terrible comic, 
until I learned 
that he actually is 
seriously, for real, 
mentally retarded. 
And now I think he's 
an inspiration and a hero. 
So please welcome America's 
special needs comedian, 
Jeff Ross. 
Yeah! 
Give it up for the warlock! 
Friends, roasters, enablers, 
Page 15/47
lend Mike Tyson your ears. 
Because this lineup 
is so pathetic, 
I was hoping I'd get replaced 
by Ashton Kutcher. 
What a bunch of nobodies 
we're left with. 
Is this a roast 
or the republican primaries? 
This is hard. 
How do you roast a meltdown? 
Charlie's meltdown was so bad, Al Gore's making 
a documentary about it. 
Tell us, Charlie. 
How do you go from being 
TVs highest-paid actor ever 
to being the highest actor 
ever to be on TV? 
Charlie's nostrils are 
so snotty and full of coke 
he calls them 
the Hilton sisters. 
Instead of getting his life 
together, 
Charlie went out on 
a national comedy tour... 
Where every night, Charlie, 
you walked on stage 
and you told the audience 
you were a warlock from Mars. 
Oh, maybe you are. 
But I'll tell you 
what you're not-- 
a comedian from earth. 
Charlie Sheen is to stand-up 
what Larry Flynt 
is to standing up. 
Charlie, if you're winning, 
then something's wrong 
with the [bleep] scoreboard. 
Come on, man. 
Charlie, if you're winning, 
then this must not be 
Page 16/47
a child custody hearing. 
The only time your kids 
get to see you is in reruns. 
Charlie, don't you want to live to see their first 12 steps? 
You're the black sheep 
of a family 
responsible for three 
Mighty Ducks movies. 
You make your own 
father ashamed 
that he shares the same 
fake name as you. 
Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez said they would have 
been here tonight, 
but they had 
a family obligation. 
Charlie's never lonely. 
Don't worry. 
I've been up to that house. 
I can tell you that Charlie 
is stockpiling whores up there. The place is packed 
with whores. 
Charlie, 
you should be on Hoarders. 
Charlie Sheen 
has paid for so much sex, 
he keeps his credit card 
under his balls to save time. 
Anthony Jeselnik, some say 
you're the next Greg Giraldo. 
Let's hope so. 
Where's slash? 
There he is. 
Slash, you were awesome 
in the open of the show, man. 
That was cool. 
Always in that top hat, man. 
You're like the Abe Lincoln 
of rock and roll... 
Especially since 
you haven't had a hit 
Page 17/47
in four score and seven years. Yeah. 
I'm kidding, slash. 
Thanks for playing my nephew's bar mitzvah last year. 
That was cool. 
That was really cool. 
And oh, wow, look at that. 
Looking good, Brooke Mueller. 
Charlie's ex. 
What's up, babe? 
What's up? 
She's not very bright 
unless Charlie's throwing 
a lamp at her. 
Too soon? 
Oh, Jon Lovitz. 
Great job tonight, man. 
That was funny. 
Nice to see you taking a break from taking a break. 
Jon, what's your catch phrase? "Chinning!" 
And there's our old 
roast honoree, 
William Shatner, one of 
the coolest guys in the world. I'm not gonna make fun of him, 'cause he looks like 
he's on his final frontier. 
Hey, Captain Kirk, 
maybe Scotty can beam your balls up from the floor... 
You old pervert. 
Backstage he flashed Kate Walsh his graying anatomy. 
And I can't believe 
I get to sit 
next to the-- 
"Iron" Mike Tyson, man, 
one of the coolest, most amazing athletes in the world. 
Thanks for rolling with 
the punches tonight, champ. 
Page 18/47
Thank you, Jeff. 
Thank you, Jeff. 
I bet you haven't been 
shit on this hard 
since you cleaned 
your pigeon Coop this morning. Not only do you love pigeons, 
but you sound like one. 
Listen, I'm not gonna make fun of Mike Tyson, 
because if he-- 
That's right. 'Cause I'm gonna shit on you tonight. 
That's right. 
I know, I know. 
If you're willing to do that 
to your face, 
imagine what 
he would do to mine. 
What is that on your face, 
a target for pepper spray? 
Mike, the ironic thing is, 
after all the faces 
you bashed in, 
the one you [bleep] up 
the most is your own. 
Ah, but there's no denying 
the fact that Mike Tyson 
had the hardest-hitting 
right hook in history. 
Your opponents spent more time bleeding in the corner 
than Charlie's ex-wives. 
Too soon? Too soon? 
Too real? Too real? 
Has anybody seen your ex-goddess Bree Olson's latest movie? 
Last time I saw that many guys coming out of the same hole, 
I was watching the rescue 
of the Chilean miners. 
Charlie, by taking 
these punches from us tonight, you've proved to all your fans 
Page 19/47
that you're the new king 
of the comebacks. 
Yeah. 
In fact... 
In fact you've [bleep] 
on more backs 
than anyone in Hollywood. 
Charlie, 
when you were on the tour, 
I roasted you eight times 
in eight different cities. 
And I got meaner every time. 
You were a great sport-- 
perhaps the greatest sport 
in roast history, 
and I don't know 
what you're gonna do next, 
but whatever you decide, 
I know firsthand that there's 
an army of fans out there 
waiting to check it out 
and support you 
in a big way. 
I love you guys. 
Thank you so much. 
The warlock--the best. 
Coming up... 
We're not gonna be bashing 
ourselves, 
but we're gonna listen 
to Charlie get bashed. 
Mike Tyson, 
Steve-O, 
and William Shatner. 
We roasted William Shatner, 
and now he's back to show 
everybody he's a good sport. 
No, I'm not a good sport. 
I'm after revenge. 
All right, our next roaster 
is Mike Tyson. 
Tyson has had three marriages. The first two 
ended in knockouts. 
Page 20/47
He's a guy-- 
I threw in the [bleep] towel. 
Please don't murder me. 
He's a guy... 
He's a guy who's beaten every 
opponent he has gone up against except the letter "S." 
So... 
So now please... 
Please be patient 
as he sounds out his jokes. 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
"Iron" Mike Tyson! 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Oh, shit. 
Thank you. 
Thank you very much, Seth. 
Oh, man. 
Well, you know, during 
a very dark period in my life, I found inspiration 
by reading the great 
epic poet the Iliad. 
So, see, Seth, 
you're not the only person 
that gotten by 
by taking ideas from homer. 
That's a [bleep] idiot 
over there. 
He's a [bleep] idiot, 
with that Stewie. 
Okay. 
All right. 
Well, if I must confess, 
I'm really not a roaster. 
Of course, you know, everyone, I don't like hurting people. 
And, um, I'm living, you know, more of a spiritual life now 
through poetry, 
and I've written... 
Well, you know, 
I've written, you know, 
Page 21/47
many verses 
in my secret garden, 
and now I'd like to share them with a few of you here today. 
Thank you, everybody. 
Well, this'll be a honor, 
because, um, as the bard 
once said, 
"All the world's a stage." 
And Charlie's been booed off 
them all, of course. 
In this first verse, 
you'll recognize the classic 
a-a-b-b-a poetic structure. 
There once was a old man 
named Ross 
whose jokes 
were covered with moss. 
His punch line was musty, 
his premise was dusty, 
I wish he'd suck on a [bleep] 
exhaust, you know? 
Oh. 
So excuse me. 
What you gonna do, Jeff? 
What the [bleep] 
you gonna do, Jeff? 
You know, I'm-- 
you know, I must say, you know, I'm rather intrigued 
by your puffy, grotesque 
[bleep] face, Jeff, you know? 
Normally--normally 
when I'm next to somebody 
whose face 
is grotesque as yours, 
they throw in 
the [bleep] towel, man. 
You're a mess, man. 
During your performance, 
I wish I bit my own ears off. 
You know? 
You [bleep] suck, man. 
You suck! 
Page 22/47
Yes, I wish I bit my own shit. All right. All right. 
- That was the best. 
- All right. 
Now-- 
no, come on, stop. 
I got to do this shit right. 
All right. 
I didn't do well in school, 
but I'm trying to do this shit. All right. 
Charlie, our next poem 
was inspired 
by the great Emily Dickinson, 
who I consider a real goddess. You know, whatever happened 
to them hos, man? 
Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry. 
But, Charlie, 
let me remind you... 
Something every man must know. Once the money goes, 
so does the hos. 
Trust me on that one, Charlie. Man, come on, 
let's keep it real. 
You know, Brooke, 
Charlie had every [bleep] 
disease known to man, 
but still, 
you [bleep] his [bleep] 
before you shake 
Steve-O's hand, you know? 
This wife-beating cokehead 
claims he's some 
rock star from Mars. 
Man, if he was black, his ass 
would be behind bars, you know? Which is [bleep] bullshit, 
because I'm 
the greatest poet alive! 
I'm the greatest 
wordsmith ever. 
I'm the--I'm Robert Frost. 
Page 23/47
I'm--I'm Lord Byron. 
My verses are impetuous, 
my rhymes impregnable. 
I want to eat your children! 
I--I... 
But, of course, 
I'm using poetic license, 
and, um, they haven't 
revoked that one yet. 
And thank you all, guys. 
May you guys continue 
and resume to being nasty 
and talking mean 
to one another. 
God bless you. 
Bye, guys. 
I'm finished. 
Thank you. 
Still to come, 
Anthony Jeselnik... 
Charlie Sheen keeps saying 
he's winning. 
That guy couldn't win 
a goddamn coin toss. 
- William Shatner... 
- Will you sit down? 
And Charlie Sheen. 
You can't help 
but feel for him, 
'cause he is your friend, 
plus, uh, you know, 
he owes me a hooker, 
so I'm looking for-- 
does anybody know where he is? Our next roaster 
is Anthony Jeselnik. 
Anthony Jeselnik's act 
combines the excitement 
of standing there 
with the thrill 
of saying words. 
You know him best from me 
saying his name right now. 
Please welcome a man 
Page 24/47
who's got a bright future 
in something other than comedy, Anthony Jeselnik. 
Thank you. 
Seth MacFarlane, 
everybody, huh? 
This is MacFarlane's third time hosting the show, 
which should come 
as no surprise, 
because when Seth MacFarlane 
does something, 
by God, he repeats 
the living shit out of it. 
My good friend 
Jeff Ross is here... 
Even though it's laundry day. 
And Kate Walsh... 
I don't watch 
that stupid show you're on. 
But I did think 
it was interesting 
that you have your own line 
of perfume, you know, 
for that special lady 
who wants to smell like 
"Who gives a [bleep]?" 
I'm glad William Shatner 
could squeeze this roast 
into his schedule... 
In between cosmetic surgeries. Bill, your face is so plastic 
that when you're done with it, they're gonna have to cut it up into little pieces 
so that birds don't die. 
What's up, Steve-O? 
Steve-O, I know you were 
in a dark place for a while. 
You were struggling. 
But now you're trying 
stand-up comedy. 
I actually saw you perform 
once at the comedy cellar, 
Page 25/47
and here's some free advice, 
Steve-O. 
Don't give up your suicide. 
Patrice O'Neal is here. 
You literally cannot miss him. Holy Christ, you're fat. 
You look like 
you deep-fry your hands 
before you bite 
your fingernails. 
That's a good joke. 
That's a racist joke! 
That's some racist shit 
right there. 
Mike Tyson. 
That's the whole joke. 
Mike Tyson, I love you. 
You're my favorite boxer 
of all time. 
I don't even want to stand up 
here and make fun of you. 
Besides, what can you say 
about Mike Tyson 
that hasn't already been the 
title of a Richard Pryor album. Oh, shit. 
- He got it. 
- I did. 
Patrice got it. 
Too many white people 
to get that. 
Too many white people? 
You know what no one ever says is "too few black people." 
Yeah. 
Mike, to me, you will always 
be the champion. 
You will always 
be the champion... 
Thank you very much. 
The champion of having more 
shit on your face than seal. 
Mike Tyson 
got a tattoo on his face 
Page 26/47
so that every time 
he looks in the mirror, 
he can be proud 
that converting to Islam 
is only the second dumbest 
thing he's ever done. 
That's good. 
You regret it. 
I well may. 
And now 
for the man of the hour, 
Mr. Charlie Sheen. 
Charlie, I don't understand 
why you're not grateful 
for what you have right now. 
I mean, after all, 
the only reason you got on TV 
in the first place 
is because God hates 
Michael j. Fox. 
Charlie, you are a monster. 
Every moment of your life 
looks like the first two minutes 
of Law & Order: 
You've convinced more women 
to have abortions 
than the prenatal test 
for [bleep] syndrome. 
And, Charlie, I think 
the craziest thing about you 
is that you thought you were 
gonna go back to your TV show 
after calling your boss 
a "Jew [bleep]." 
If people got 
to keep their jobs 
after calling their boss 
a Jew [bleep], Charlie, 
then everyone would do it. 
But, Charlie, 
despite everything 
I've just said, 
you're a good sport 
Page 27/47
for being here tonight. 
Thanks for letting me 
be here, too. 
Thank you, everybody. 
Thanks a lot. 
The Comedy Central Roast 
of Charlie Sheen 
is brought to you 
by FIFA Soccer 12. 
Still to come, Steve-O... 
This is critical 
if I'm gonna have a future 
beyond breaking bones 
and shoving things up my butt. Amy Schumer... 
I'm gonna get 
shit-faced. 
I'm gonna be slurring 
and throwing up on strangers. 
And Patrice O'Neal. 
This should be 
my last show ever. 
Uh, our next roaster 
is Steve-O. 
This guy makes it easy for us 
to bust his balls 
and pull his leg, 
because his balls are usually 
stapled to his leg. 
So, now, please give up 
your horse semen for Steve-O. 
What an honor to be here 
with Mike Tyson. 
The last time 
I hung out with Mike, 
we locked ourselves 
in a bathroom 
and ripped through 
five grams of cocaine. 
But Mike's really 
changed his ways, though. 
See, here he is taking 
a beating for a check, 
and it hasn't been made out 
Page 28/47
to Don King. 
That is a good one. 
That is a good one. 
Some people know Kate Walsh 
as a television actress, 
but most people 
don't know her at all. 
And my hero... 
Charlie Sheen. 
Charlie definitely has 
tiger blood 
coursing through his veins. 
Unfortunately, that tiger is 
a helpless drug addict. 
Dude, your nose is like my ass. There's nothing 
you won't shove up there. 
I've been clean and sober 
for 3 1/2 years now... 
But Charlie still 
hasn't hit rock bottom. 
I know he's looking forward 
to it, though, 
because he thinks 
there's a rock there. 
You know, when Charlie started referring to his girlfriends 
as goddesses, 
I was confused, 
so I looked it up 
in the dictionary. 
It said, 
"Goddesses, plural, noun-- 
two [bleep] dumpsters who got 
sick of buying their own drugs." But, Charlie, 
don't ever pretend 
that you're not a totally 
bitchin' rock star from Mars, 
because you are. 
And I love you. 
And I am so grateful 
that you've let me be 
a part of this tonight. 
Page 29/47
Right now I'm gonna do something insanely stupid for you. 
I am going to attempt 
to get a black eye 
from the former heavyweight 
champion of the world. 
Mike, bro, I am ready. 
Let me get that fist. 
Man, I don't want 
to do this shit, man. 
We're not gonna call the police or anything after this. 
[Bleep] him up, Mike! 
All right. 
Okay. 
One, two, three. 
Go for it. 
Aah! 
Ah. 
I think that'll do it. 
Thank you, everybody. 
Wow. 
That's what it looks like when an asshole gets fisted, I guess. All right. 
All right, what can I say 
about Amy Schumer? 
Um, I actually 
mean that sincerely. 
I've never heard of this woman. So please get ready 
for the comedy stylings 
of the fourth runner-up 
of the fifth season 
of Last Comic Standing, 
Amy Schumer. 
Mike "Tython." 
Am I saying that right? 
Ha ha. 
I'll get you good. 
Wasn't he great up here? 
No, I'm asking. 
I couldn't understand 
a [bleep] word he said. 
Page 30/47
Mike, your voice sounds 
like a girl crying. 
Every time you speak, 
do you give yourself 
an erection? 
Sometimes. 
Depends what I'm talking about-- Hey, hey, hey, Mike, 
here's something 
you'll never hear-- 
"Great tattoo!" 
You have a slutty 
lower-back tattoo on your face. Men don't know 
whether to be scared of it 
or finish on it. 
Look at that face. 
It's so-- 
it's so dark and wrinkly 
and constantly getting pounded. It's like Patrice's 
grandmother's asshole 
after a gospel brunch. 
Oh. Shit. 
I'm just assuming 
she raised you. 
Patrice O'Neal, 
one of my favorite comics-- 
Patrice has always been destined for stardom and diabetes. 
So tonight is not just 
the roast of Charlie Sheen. 
It's also a farewell party 
for Patrice's foot. 
Diabetes--holy shit. 
Evil. Sitting next to this bitch the whole time. 
I didn't know she-- 
this was coming. 
It's true. 
If Amy had as many dicks 
coming out as she had going in, she'd look like 
a [bleep] porcupine. 
Page 31/47
Is his interpreter here? 
Anthony, 
what's your last name-- 
Uh, Van Der Sloot? 
What is it? 
Uh... 
You have all the likeability 
of a Hitler youth. 
Look at you. 
Speaking of Kate Walsh, 
Kate, to some people, 
Grey's Anatomy 
is more than a TV show. 
In fact, Grey's Anatomy 
is what William Shatner 
calls his balls. 
Right? 
William. 
I've seen less bloated men 
dredged out of rivers. 
What's going on? 
Wha--does Priceline pay you 
in empanadas? 
What's happening? 
- Are you taking that from her? - Oh, yeah, we have to. 
- You got to get her back! 
- Go get her. 
And Steve-O is here. 
Steve-O, great try. 
Steve-O... 
But I truly am, no joke, 
sorry for the loss 
of your friend Ryan Dunn. 
I know 
you must have been thinking, 
"It could have been me," 
and I know we were all thinking, "Why wasn't it?" 
Um... 
Thank you. 
[Bleep] you, Amy! 
Oh, Mike. 
Stay away from me. 
Page 32/47
Speaking of things 
that should already be dead, 
Charlie Sheen is still alive. 
Charlie, you--I'm a fan. 
You were amazing in Platoon. 
Your marriage 
to Denise Richards, 
it was kind of like 
her Vietnam, 
'cause she was constantly afraid of being killed by Charlie. 
But there's no denying 
how famous you are. 
I mean, 
it was international news 
when you ruined the lives 
of those two girls living 
with you-- 
you know, your daughters. 
But, no, I mean, Charlie, 
you get a bad rap, 
but you're just like 
Bruce Willis. 
You know, you were big 
in the '80s, 
and now your old slot's being 
filled with Ashton Kutcher. 
But all joking aside, 
if you ever need a friend 
to pee in a cup for you, 
I'm your gal. 
Thanks for having me. 
You know what's funny? 
I have never met 
William Shatner. 
Coming up, William Shatner... 
And I'm very much looking 
forward to meeting Shatner. 
Patrice O'Neal... 
That shit is crazy, man. 
And Charlie Sheen. 
I think if-- 
Wow. Look at those statues. 
Sorry. 
Page 33/47
What was the question? 
All right, our next roaster 
is the legendary 
William Shatner. 
Here he is. 
I can't joke about this guy, 
'cause I think he's 
the [bleep] greatest. 
The guy who played Captain Kirk back before Star Trek looked 
like a bunch of gay guys 
working in a Mac store, 
William Shatner. 
Thank you, thank you, 
thank you. 
Keep it going for Chaz Bono. 
Uh, Charlie... 
I was driving by tonight, 
and I heard that 
they were doing your roast, 
and I thought what a great-- 
great opportunity 
to offer this young Mexican... A bit of fatherly advice 
he so clearly 
hasn't been getting. 
You see, I've been doing this 
for quite a while now, 
and I think that, uh, 
I can bestow on you 
some of the vast wisdom 
from my experience 
in this wonderful business 
of entertainment. 
Uh, first off, Charlie, 
I'm, uh... 
I'm 80 years old. 
You're, what, 47? 
How come we look like 
we went to high school together? And, uh... 
And you're going too fast, son. You got to slow down 
and smell the roses, my boy. 
Page 34/47
That's why I have 
such a storied and... 
Illustrious career... 
Because I'm patient. 
I was willing 
to wait a long time 
to get 
into the right projects... 
Just like 
Patrice O'Neal's family. 
Okay, Charlie. 
So you're out of a job. 
Don't feel sad. 
I know another famous guy 
who was kind to whores 
and always kept 
12 losers around, 
and he got crucified 
by Jews, too. 
And people worshipped that guy. Look, look, Carlos... 
I've had my share of wild times with the seoritas. 
Yeah. 
I've had sex in space 
with green women. 
Sure, you've had sex 
with blue women, 
because unlike you, they 
couldn't handle their drugs. 
You don't need 
that kind of press, Charlie! 
In my day, if I wanted 
that kind of publicity, 
I had to do something drastic, like kiss a black girl...... 
Or let an Asian drive. 
Oh. 
May I suggest 
to you, Charlie... 
That you reexamine 
your relations with women? 
Prostitutes cost a lot 
of money, Charlie. 
Page 35/47
Hasn't anyone told you 
that actresses 
will sleep with you for free? 
Man, that's-- 
that's Hollywood 101. 
You should have called. 
You know, uh, what will help you get through this-- 
this--this tough spot, 
something--you have 
to give something back. 
See, I was at--recently 
at a celebrity auction 
where I sold 
one of my kidney stones 
for $75,000. 
Oh, yeah. 
Oh, yeah. 
Do you understand 
what I've done? 
I synthesized uric acid 
and calcium 
inside my bladder 
and turned it into a house 
for habitat for humanity. 
Who's the warlock now, bitch? 
Actually, Emilio... 
We're not that different. 
You're a rock star from Mars. 
Yes, you are. 
And as one rocket man 
to another, 
if I may give you 
my most important piece 
of advice tonight-- 
never, ever forget to book 
your next rehab stay 
through priceline.com. 
Now, Charlie, see, 
you take it from the master. 
That little subtle plug there-- $65 right in the pocket. 
Whoa, my, look at the time. 
Oh, jeez. 
Page 36/47
I got to simply-- 
I must get home. 
I want to catch 
that new Ashton Kutcher show. 
Do you--do you know him? 
- He's a nice guy. 
- No. 
I went to high school 
with his wife. 
Thank you very much. 
It was funny. 
He was so [bleep] Shatner-y. 
How awesome was that? 
Um... 
Our next roaster 
is Patrice O'Neal. 
You may recognize Patrice 
from his many speaking roles 
in movies, 
but only if you've sat 
in front of him in a theater. 
Um... 
I know. 
I know. Some of these jokes 
may come off racist, 
which is why 
it's important to remember 
that Rosa Parks fought 
so Patrice could take 
three seats on the bus. 
So please welcome a guy 
who looks like Chris Farley 
after a mine-shaft explosion, 
the very funny Patrice O'Neal. Thank you. 
Thank you very much. 
I, uh... 
It's just strange, 'cause... 
I had all this planned shit, 
but I didn't... 
Like, I didn't know 
William Shatner 
was gonna be quasi... 
Like, a old racist man. 
Page 37/47
Like, but... 
But everybody's giggling, 
like, "Whoa, he's..." 
You're a [bleep] asshole, 
Captain Kirk. 
What are you talking about? 
Like, I don't respect him, 
but, like, I'll respect him, 
'cause he's [bleep] 
Captain Kirk, 
but I think he might be racist, 'cause his hair plugs look like black girls' [bleep] hair. 
This is [bleep] amazing. 
Like, I wasn't gonna be mean 
to Anthony. 
I don't know him. 
I never met him. 
Like, so I'm sitting 
here watching him, 
and I'm like, "He has 
way too much confidence." 
Like, in my world, 
he's an open-miker. 
Nobody knows him, 
and nobody should. 
Nobody should [bleep] know 
Anthony, uh... 
I refuse to learn 
his last shitty name. 
I learned Galifianakis. 
That's the last 
shitty last name 
this [bleep] gonna learn 
in this [bleep] funky town. 
He reminds me of 
a medieval restaurant waiter. 
Like... 
His whole demeanor. 
Like, 
"Hello, may I welcome to--" 
and you just want to go, 
"Shut the [bleep] up 
"and bring me 
Page 38/47
my giant turkey leg, 
you [bleep] nothing." 
How the [bleep] can I be 
too mean after all this shit? 
I can't believe it. 
I'm dying of diabetes, 
and you mother[bleep] are like, "Oh, that evil, fat [bleep]." 
You know. 
I consider Seth an icon. 
I do. 
Like, I got a critique 
about Seth. 
It--it's too much Seth. 
It's... 
Like, it's almost like he's 
jealous of his own creation. 
Where he wants to prove 
"I'm better than the cartoons." But he's not better 
than the cartoons. 
See, but I think 
the problem is with Seth 
is that he don't have 
a partner, 
you know, 
like the South Park guys 
or Hanna-Barbera. 
I know we've read 
that old story 
that, uh, Hanna once said, 
"I'm bigger than Yogi," 
and Barbera slapped the shit 
out of him for saying that? 
Seth needs a Barbera... 
To slap him and slap him twice. Once to say, "Hey, man, don't 
forget why people love you." 
And two, 
"Just say you're gay." 
No... 
No straight man 
writes that many show tunes. 
That's a fact. 
Page 39/47
I love Mike Tyson, 
and I don't have much to say. 
I'm just disappointed and hurt at how much comfort white people have around you now. 
I don't--I don't like it. 
And Steve-O, 
this new, subdued, 
"not drunk" you, 
it [bleep] stinks, man. 
Why are you still looking at me like that, Mr. Shatner, sir? 
Are you like, "Boy, 
I had more for that [bleep]. 
I didn't say it. 
I should have said it, 
'cause he's an asshole. 
You're telling it as it is. 
You're telling it like it is. 
Jeff Ross, I love you, I guess. Look, Jeff Ross is a legend. 
His funniness is a legend. 
But when I say "legend," 
I mean a myth... 
Like the Loch Ness monster 
or Bigfoot. 
Like, 
we all believe they exist, 
but who really ever saw it? 
Ah, shit. 
I've turned down many roasts. 
I have-- 
about three or four of 'em. 
And I said yes to this, 
and I'm dead-ass serious. 
I said yes to this because, uh, I respect Charlie Sheen. 
I do. 
I said yes 'cause I respe-- 
not--not--not 
his body of work. 
Like, not... 
It's all been 
very Christian Slater-ish. 
Page 40/47
Like it just, like... 
He sucks, but he's good. 
But he sucks at the same time. Uh, I think 
that his stand that he made, 
uh, against the business-- 
I think this 
is a [bleep]-up business, 
but he stood up, 
he still survived, 
uh, and he proved 
that nobody can keep, like, 
a Sheen down, you know? 
They can keep a Estevez down, 
'cause his brother... 
And he's the good one. 
That mother[bleep] 
do everything right, 
and that [bleep] career 
is over. 
Holy shit. 
[Bleep] tiger blood. 
He's selling his own blood 
to make money. 
But I wanted to say 
to your eyes, man, 
I-I-I... 
I love that you stood up 
to what you thought was wrong, and, uh, I'm impressed by you, and I wanted to say that. 
So thank you, man. 
Thanks for having me. 
Y'all take care. 
Thank you. 
Still to come, 
Charlie Sheen goes off. 
He's winning. 
I mean, when you're winning, 
you can take anything. 
Give it as good 
as you get it, my friend. 
I hope all you clowns 
are ready for my "sheenius." 
Page 41/47
And now it is time 
for the moment 
we've all been waiting for. 
We're gonna get to hear 
a ranting tirade 
from the man himself. 
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I give you a man 
with a big heart, 
because it's been dangerously 
enlarged by cocaine use, 
Charlie Sheen. 
Wild thing 
you make my heart sing 
you make everything 
groovy 
come on, come on, 
wild thing 
Hi. Hello. 
I'm Charlie. 
Wow. 
Wow [bleep] Wow. 
What a night. 
Until tonight, I never realized how [bleep] up I was. 
All this time, I thought 
I was just having fun. 
Yeah, it's true. 
It's true. 
I've hung around with a lot 
of shady people over the years-- losers, drug addicts, 
dealers, desperate whores. 
But to have you all here 
on one night is really special. My thanks to Seth MacFarlane. 
Great job tonight. 
Look at you. 
Look at you, Seth. 
You've got the-- 
got the spray-on tan, 
the waxed eyebrows, 
the peck implants, 
halogen teeth, 
Page 42/47
the bleached anus... 
The scrotal tuck, 
nipple enlargement, 
taint augmentation. 
But I got to admit, I envy you. You've got boatloads of money, three TV shows, 
and still, even with 
all the work you've had done, 
you can talk down the street 
totally unrecognized. 
Yes. 
Yeah. 
Tonight I put all 
the craziness behind me. 
I say let the past 
stay in the past... 
With Jon Lovitz. 
Steve-O, 
you're an animal, man. 
People say I'm crazy, 
but you, you're the real deal. This guy actually got a tattoo of his own face on his back. 
There it is. 
There it is. 
Even he knows 
it was a huge mistake, 
because it makes 
Johnny Knoxville's [bleep] 
go soft. 
Kate Walsh. 
I don't know anyone 
who watches your show... 
Because I date women 
who can still get their period. Anthony Jeselnik. 
I really liked 
your slow, measured delivery. 
It's as if you were trying to-- trying to savor the moment. 
Years from now when you're 
locking up at Radioshack... 
You'll look back 
Page 43/47

at tonight and say... 
"I... 
"Wish...I... 
"Was... 
Funnier." 
Goddamn. 
Seriously, dude, the only 
thing slower than your delivery is Patrice O'Neal's metabolism. When I first 
saw Patrice on the stage, 
I thought the same thing 
we all did-- 
Why is Mike Tyson's 
mother here? 
But, Mike, no, no, 
Mike, Mike, Mike, 
- you were fantastic tonight. 
- Oh, shit. 
By the way, Mike, 
I'm sorry for drinking 
all the blood out of your tiger. I was going through 
a weird phase. 
Ah, look, there he is-- 
Jeff Ross. 
Jeff, Jeff, that Gaddafi outfit is perfect for you, 
because you have what I would 
call a Libyan face. 
By that, I mean 
it's [bleep] revolting. 
Oh, hey, look. 
Look. 
It's former funnyman 
Jon Lovitz. 
Just last week, 
we were out on the golf course, we chatted, had a few laughs, 
then he got back 
on the mower and drove off. 
And Amy Schumer. 
Great job. 
You really [bleep] me tonight... Page 44/47

Which I dig, because 
I'm into anonymous sex. 
And no one's more 
anonymous here than Amy Schumer. I mean, 
I'm Charlie [bleep] Sheen. 
They know me on Mars. 
They don't know you 
in this room. 
You know, I personally asked 
that William Shatner be here, 
only because I needed 
some clean urine. 
I had to wring it 
out of the diaper, 
but it did the job. 
Bill, you've always been 
an inspiration to my acting. 
It was your work on Star Trek 
that inspired me 
to act like an asshole 
until the rest of the cast 
stopped speaking to me. 
But, look, look, 
this has been, um... 
This has been both 
enlightening and fun. 
You are all worthy adversaries. But the thing is, 
once again, 
I have come out unscathed. 
You can't hurt me. 
Hell, I can't even hurt me. 
Drugs couldn't kill me. 
Sex couldn't kill me. 
The press couldn't kill me. 
Two and a Half Men 
couldn't kill me. 
Did you really think 
your little jokes 
were gonna hurt me? 
I'm the wild thing-- 
Ricky [bleep] Vaughn, man. 
You're looking at a guy 
Page 45/47
who thrives on chaos. 
At ten years old, I was 
on the set of Apocalypse Now 
in the Philippine jungle, 
playing with severed heads 
in Colonel Kurtz's compound. 
When I did Ferris Bueller, 
my first line in the film 
was "drugs?" 
I thought they were asking me 
how I wanted to be paid. 
After Platoon, Wall Street, 
and Major League, 
I went on to have the biggest 
salary on television. 
Sounds great, right? 
It was. 
No, really. 
It [bleep] was. 
I did porn stars. 
I did drugs. 
I had my own television show. 
And then... 
Then I did the one thing 
that everyone in America 
really wishes they could do. 
I told my boss to [bleep] off. And then it was gone... 
In one fiery 
public flame-out. 
And it was only 
when the smoke cleared, 
I realized just how lucky I am, because even after all that, 
I still have a family 
that loves me. 
That's why 
they're not here tonight. 
Yeah, they've-- 
they've seen me in jail. 
They've seen me 
rushed to emergency rooms. 
They've seen me 
dragged into court. 
Page 46/47
But seeing me on basic cable 
would kill them. 
But I know-- 
I know that my family 
will always be there for me, 
so... 
What I'm trying to say is that I'm done with "the winning," 
because I've already won. 
- Yeah. 
- Yeah. 
This roast may be over, 
but I'm Charlie Sheen. 
And in here-- 
in here burns 
an eternal fire. 
I just have to remember 
to keep it away 
from a crack pipe. 
I'll see you all 
in the next adventure. 
I love you. 
Good night. Thank you. 
Mike. 
- Oh, he's doing it again? 
- Yeah. 
Come on, Steve-O. 
- Don't hurt me. 
- Oh!
