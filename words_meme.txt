The Entire Bee Movie Script
Bee Movie Script - Dialogue Transcript

  
According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick our job today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

  
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

  
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

  
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

  
Barry!

  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

  
What happened to you?
Where are you?

  
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

  
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

  
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

  
Another call coming in.

  
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

  
that gets their roses today.

  
Hey, guys.

  
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

  
- Thank you.
- OK.

  
You got a rain advisory today,

  
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

  
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

  
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

  
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

  
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

  
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

  
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

  
All right, launch positions!

  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

  
Black and yellow!

  
Hello!

  
You ready for this, hot shot?

  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

  
Wind, check.

  
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

  
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

  
Scared out of my shorts, check.

  
OK, ladies,

  
let's move it out!

  
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

  
All of you, drain those flowers!

  
Wow! I'm out!

  
I can't believe I'm out!

  
So blue.

  
I feel so fast and free!

  
Box kite!

  
Wow!

  
Flowers!

  
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

  
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

  
Roses!

  
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

  
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

  
That is one nectar collector!

  
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,

  
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

  
Oool.

  
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?

  
Oopy that visual.

  
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

  
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

  
Affirmative.

  
That was on the line!

  
This is the coolest. What is it?

  
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

  
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

  
Yeah, fuzzy.

  
Ohemical-y.

  
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.

  
My sweet lord of bees!

  
Oandy-brain, get off there!

  
Problem!

  
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

  
Affirmative.

  
Very close.

  
Gonna hurt.

  
Mama's little boy.

  
You are way out of position, rookie!

  
Ooming in at you like a missile!

  
Help me!

  
I don't think these are flowers.

  
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

  
What is this?!

  
Match point!

  
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

  
Yowser!

  
Gross.

  
There's a bee in the car!

  
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

  
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

  
He's going to sting me!

  
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

  
He blinked!

  
Spray him, Granny!

  
What are you doing?!

  
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

  
I gotta get home.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

  
You see? Folds out.

  
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

  
What was that?

  
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

  
Drapes!

  
That is diabolical.

  
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

  
What's number one? Star Wars?

  
Nah, I don't go for that...

  
...kind of stuff.

  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

  
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

  
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

  
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

  
I predicted global warming.

  
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

  
Wait! Stop! Bee!

  
Stand back. These are winter boots.

  
Wait!

  
Don't kill him!

  
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

  
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

  
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

  
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.

  
My brochure!

  
There you go, little guy.

  
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

  
Put that on your resume brochure.

  
My whole face could puff up.

  
Make it one of your special skills.

  
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

  
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

  
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

  
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

  
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

  
I gotta say something.

  
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

  
All right, here it goes.

  
Nah.

  
What would I say?

  
I could really get in trouble.

  
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

  
I can't believe I'm doing this.

  
I've got to.

  
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

  
No. Yes. No.

  
Do it. I can't.

  
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.

  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

  
Hi!

  
I'm sorry.

  
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

  
You're talking!

  
I'm so sorry.

  
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

  
But I don't recall going to bed.

  
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

  
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

  
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

  
but they were all trying to kill me.

  
And if it wasn't for you...

  
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

  
That was a little weird.

  
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

  
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

  
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

  
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

  
The talking thing.

  
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

  
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

  
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

  
Anyway...

  
Oan I...

  
...get you something?
- Like what?

  
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

  
I don't want to put you out.

  
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

  
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

  
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

  
Hey, you want rum cake?

  
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

  
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

  
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

  
You look great!

  
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

  
Are you all right?

  
No.

  
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

  
He finally gets there.

  
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

  
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

  
Why would I marry a watermelon?"

  
Is that a bee joke?

  
That's the kind of stuff we do.

  
Yeah, different.

  
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

  
About work? I don't know.

  
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

  
I know how you feel.

  
- You do?
- Sure.

  
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

  
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

  
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

  
Anyway, if you look...

  
There's my hive right there. See it?

  
You're in Sheep Meadow!

  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

  
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

  
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

  
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.

  
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

  
Just having two cups of coffee!

  
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

  
Yeah, it's no trouble.

  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.

  
Are you...?

  
Oan I take a piece of this with me?

  
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

  
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

  
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

  
Or not.

  
OK, Barry.

  
And thank you
so much again... for before.

  
Oh, that? That was nothing.

  
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

  
This can't possibly work.

  
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

  
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

  
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

  
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

  
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

  
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

  
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

  
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

  
You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out your job and be normal.

  
- Well...
- Well?

  
Well, I met someone.

  
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

  
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

  
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

  
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

  
I can't get by that face.

  
So who is she?

  
She's... human.

  
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

  
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.

  
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

  
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

  
We're not dating.

  
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

  
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

  
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

  
This is over!

  
Eat this.

  
This is not over! What was that?

  
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

  
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

  
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.

  
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

  
Sit down!

  
...really hot!
- Listen to me!

  
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

  
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

  
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

  
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
There he is. He's in the pool.

  
You know what your problem is, Barry?

  
I gotta start thinking bee?

  
How much longer will this go on?

  
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

  
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

  
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

  
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

  
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

  
Martin, would you talk to him?

  
Barry, I'm talking to you!

  
You coming?

  
Got everything?

  
All set!

  
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

  
Don't be too long.

  
Watch this!

  
Vanessa!

  
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

  
He doesn't respond to yelling!

  
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!

  
I'm not listening to this.

  
Sorry, I've gotta go.

  
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

  
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

  
Bye.

  
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

  
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?

  
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

  
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.

  
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

  
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

  
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

  
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

  
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

  
You don't have that?

  
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

  
Oh, my.

  
Dumb bees!

  
You must want to sting all those jerks.

  
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

  
So you have to watch your temper.

  
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

  
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

  
Anger, jealousy, lust.

  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

  
Yeah.

  
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.

  
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

  
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

  
You've really got that
down to a science.

  
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.

  
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

  
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,

  
Ray Liotta Private Select?

  
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

  
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

  
You don't have
enough food of your own?

  
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

  
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!

  
And it's hard to make it!

  
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

  
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

  
It's just honey, Barry.

  
Just what?!

  
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

  
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

  
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

  
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!

  
Hey, Hector.

  
- You almost done?
- Almost.

  
He is here. I sense it.

  
Well, I guess I'll go home now

  
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

  
You're busted, box boy!

  
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

  
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

  
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

  
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

  
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

  
You're too late! It's ours now!

  
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

  
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

  
Where is the honey coming from?

  
Tell me where!

  
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

  
Orazy person!

  
What horrible thing has happened here?

  
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now

  
they're on the road to nowhere!

  
Just keep still.

  
What? You're not dead?

  
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?

  
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

  
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

  
I'm going to Tacoma.

  
- And you?
- He really is dead.

  
All right.

  
Uh-oh!

  
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!

  
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?

  
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

  
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!

  
How much do you people need to see?!

  
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

  
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.

  
But don't kill no more bugs!

  
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!!

  
- You hear something?
- Like what?

  
Like tiny screaming.

  
Turn off the radio.

  
Whassup, bee boy?

  
Hey, Blood.

  
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

  
Wow!

  
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

  
I mean, that honey's ours.

  
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.

  
It's a close community.

  
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

  
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.

  
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

  
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

  
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

  
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

  
You got to be kidding me!

  
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!

  
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!

  
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

  
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

  
What is this place?

  
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

  
They are pinheads!

  
Pinhead.

  
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

  
The Thomas 3000!

  
Smoker?

  
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

  
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.

  
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

  
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

  
Oh, my!

  
What's going on? Are you OK?

  
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

  
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

  
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

  
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

  
That's a drag queen!

  
What is this?

  
Oh, no!

  
There's hundreds of them!

  
Bee honey.

  
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

  
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.

  
Oh, Barry, stop.

  
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.

  
Do these look like rumors?

  
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.

  
How did you get mixed up in this?

  
He's been talking to humans.

  
- What?
- Talking to humans?!

  
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

  
Make out? Barry!

  
We do not.

  
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?

  
The bees!

  
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

  
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

  
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!

  
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked

  
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

  
I remember that.

  
What right do they have to our honey?

  
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

  
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

  
Sting them where it really hurts.

  
In the face! The eye!

  
- That would hurt.
- No.

  
Up the nose? That's a killer.

  
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

  
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

  
No more bee beards!

  
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

  
Weather with Storm Stinger.

  
Sports with Buzz Larvi.

  
And Jeanette Ohung.

  
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

  
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

  
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

  
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

  
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

  
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,

  
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

  
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

  
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

  
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.

  
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

  
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

  
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.

  
How old are you?

  
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,

  
which will be the trial
of the bee century.

  
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.

  
It's a common name. Next week...

  
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

  
Next week...

  
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

  
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

  
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

  
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!

  
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

  
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

  
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

  
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!

  
I'm helping him sue the human race.

  
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.

  
This is Ken.

  
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.

  
Why does he talk again?

  
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.

  
But it's our yogurt night!

  
Bye-bye.

  
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

  
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!

  
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.

  
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

  
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.

  
So why are you helping me?

  
Bees have good qualities.

  
And it takes my mind off the shop.

  
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.

  
Those are great, if you're three.

  
And artificial flowers.

  
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.

  
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

  
Bees must hate those fake things!

  
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

  
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.

  
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.

  
You sure you want to go through with it?

  
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able

  
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

  
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

  
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,

  
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.

  
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

  
It's pretty big, isn't it?

  
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.

  
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

  
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.

  
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.

  
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

  
You boys work on this?

  
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

  
All right. Oase number 4475,

  
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry

  
is now in session.

  
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

  
A privilege.

  
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?

  
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

  
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

  
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

  
my grandmother was a simple woman.

  
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

  
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.

  
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

  
just think of what would it mean.

  
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

  
for the elastic in my britches!

  
Talking bee!

  
How do we know this isn't some sort of

  
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

  
They could be using laser beams!

  
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,

  
he could be on steroids!

  
Mr. Benson?

  
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

  
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

  
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!

  
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.

  
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

  
who think they can take it from us

  
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

  
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have

  
but everything we are!

  
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!

  
Oall your first witness.

  
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.

  
I suppose so.

  
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

  
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.

  
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.

  
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?

  
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

  
- No.
- No.

  
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,

  
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

  
They're very lovable creatures.

  
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

  
You mean like this?

  
Bears kill bees!

  
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!

  
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

  
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

  
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.

  
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.

  
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?

  
No, I haven't.

  
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example

  
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human

  
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.

  
Oh, please.

  
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

  
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.

  
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

  
That's not his real name?! You idiots!

  
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on

  
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.

  
Thank you. Thank you.

  
I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome

  
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.

  
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

  
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?

  
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't

  
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

  
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!

  
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!

  
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!

  
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!

  
Order! Order, I say!

  
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

  
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.

  
I think the jury's on our side.

  
Are we doing everything right, legally?

  
I'm a florist.

  
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

  
To a great team!

  
Well, hello.

  
- Ken!
- Hello.

  
I didn't think you were coming.

  
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.

  
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

  
Oh, that was lucky.

  
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.

  
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

  
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

  
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.

  
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.

  
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,

  
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

  
You think I don't see what you're doing?

  
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.

  
Do we?

  
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

  
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.

  
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

  
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

  
Yeah, you do that.

  
Look at that.

  
You know, I've just about had it

  
with your little mind games.

  
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

  
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

  
A lot of ads.

  
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?

  
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

  
I think something stinks in here!

  
I love the smell of flowers.

  
How do you like the smell of flames?!

  
Not as much.

  
Water bug! Not taking sides!

  
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

  
I've got issues!

  
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

  
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

  
Surf's up, dude!

  
Poo water!

  
That bowl is gnarly.

  
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

  
Kenneth! What are you doing?!

  
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

  
We need to talk!

  
He's just a little bee!

  
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

  
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?

  
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!

  
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

  
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

  
Goodbye, Ken.

  
And for your information,

  
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!

  
I'm sorry about all that.

  
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!

  
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.

  
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.

  
Are you OK for the trial?

  
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.

  
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

  
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...

  
Yeah.

  
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic

  
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.

  
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around

  
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.

  
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

  
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

  
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

  
What exactly is your relationship

  
to that woman?

  
We're friends.

  
- Good friends?
- Yes.

  
How good? Do you live together?

  
Wait a minute...

  
Are you her little...

  
...bedbug?

  
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

  
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?

  
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!

  
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!

  
Hold me back!

  
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

  
He's denouncing bees!

  
Don't y'all date your cousins?

  
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!

  
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

  
Oh, I'm hit!!

  
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

  
Order! Order!

  
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

  
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!

  
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!

  
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!

  
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.

  
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

  
from my heaving buttocks?

  
I will have order in this court. Order!

  
Order, please!

  
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race

  
took a pointed turn against the bees

  
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

  
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

  
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.

  
I...

  
I blew the whole case, didn't I?

  
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.

  
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

  
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

  
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.

  
What was it like to sting someone?

  
I can't explain it. It was all...

  
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!

  
All right.

  
You think it was all a trap?

  
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

  
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.

  
What will the humans do to us
if they win?

  
I don't know.

  
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.

  
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

  
Oh, my.

  
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?

  
- Why?
- The smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke.

  
Right. Bees don't smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.

  
That's it! That's our case!

  
It is? It's not over?

  
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

  
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

  
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.

  
Mr. Flayman.

  
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

  
Where is the rest of your team?

  
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

  
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

  
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

  
I actually heard a funny story about...

  
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs

  
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?

  
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?

  
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

  
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.

  
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

  
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

  
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

  
But you can't! We have a terrific case.

  
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

  
Show me the smoking gun!

  
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?

  
Here is your smoking gun.

  
What is that?

  
It's a bee smoker!

  
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

  
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.

  
Look at what has happened

  
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"

  
Is this what nature intended for us?

  
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines

  
and man-made wooden slat work camps?

  
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?

  
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.

  
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!

  
Free the bees! Free the bees!

  
Free the bees!

  
Free the bees! Free the bees!

  
The court finds in favor of the bees!

  
Vanessa, we won!

  
I knew you could do it! High-five!

  
Sorry.

  
I'm OK! You know what this means?

  
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.

  
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

  
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.

  
You'll regret this.

  
Barry, how much honey is out there?

  
All right. One at a time.

  
Barry, who are you wearing?

  
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

  
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?

  
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.

  
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?

  
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.

  
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,

  
every last drop.

  
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more

  
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.

  
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.

  
Wait for my signal.

  
Take him out.

  
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.

  
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...

  
But it's just a prance-about stage name!

  
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products

  
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

  
Oan't breathe.

  
Bring it in, boys!

  
Hold it right there! Good.

  
Tap it.

  
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!

  
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.

  
Shut down honey production!

  
Stop making honey!

  
Turn your key, sir!

  
What do we do now?

  
Oannonball!

  
We're shutting honey production!

  
Mission abort.

  
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.

  
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.

  
Oh, yeah?

  
What's going on? Where is everybody?

  
- Are they out celebrating?
- They're home.

  
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.

  
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.

  
At least we got our honey back.

  
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

  
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.

  
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.

  
And now...

  
Now I can't.

  
I don't understand
why they're not happy.

  
I thought their lives would be better!

  
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

  
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?

  
- What did you want to show me?
- This.

  
What happened here?

  
That is not the half of it.

  
Oh, no. Oh, my.

  
They're all wilting.

  
Doesn't look very good, does it?

  
No.

  
And whose fault do you think that is?

  
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

  
Bees?

  
Specifically, me.

  
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.

  
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

  
That's our whole SAT test right there.

  
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.

  
And then, of course...

  
The human species?

  
So if there's no more pollination,

  
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?

  
I know this is also partly my fault.

  
How about a suicide pact?

  
How do we do it?

  
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.

  
Right, right.

  
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.

  
I had to open my mouth and talk.

  
Vanessa?

  
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

  
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.

  
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.

  
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.

  
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.

  
I know. Me neither.

  
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.

  
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

  
Roses!

  
Vanessa!

  
Roses?!

  
Barry?

  
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.

  
Flowers, bees, pollen!

  
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.

  
Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?

  
Oould you slow down?

  
Barry!

  
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.

  
Yes, it kind of is.

  
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you

  
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.

  
Actually, it's completely closed down.

  
I thought maybe you were remodeling.

  
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.

  
I don't want to hear it!

  
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.

  
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.

  
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.

  
- Bees.
- Park.

  
- Pollen!
- Flowers.

  
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!

  
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.

  
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.

  
Security will be tight.

  
I have an idea.

  
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

  
Official floral business. It's real.

  
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

  
Thank you. It was a gift.

  
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.

  
How about The Princess and the Pea?

  
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!

  
Yes, I got it.

  
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?

  
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?

  
It goes under the mattresses.

  
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.

  
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!

  
Let's see what this baby'll do.

  
Hey, what are you doing?!

  
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...

  
...without arousing suspicion.

  
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.

  
Stop! Security.

  
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.

  
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?

  
Would you remove your shoes?

  
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.

  
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.

  
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.

  
Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!

  
I think this is gonna work.

  
It's got to work.

  
Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.

  
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.

  
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.

  
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.

  
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.

  
Be careful.

  
Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?

  
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.

  
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.

  
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.

  
Bee!

  
Don't freak out! My entire species...

  
What are you doing?

  
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?

  
Don't move.

  
Oh, Barry.

  
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.

  
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?

  
And please hurry!

  
What happened here?

  
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.

  
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!

  
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!

  
No one's flying the plane!

  
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?

  
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.

  
Where's the pilot?

  
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.

  
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?

  
As a matter of fact, there is.

  
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.

  
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.

  
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.

  
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

  
I can't fly a plane.

  
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.

  
How hard could it be?

  
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.

  
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,

  
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.

  
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...

  
That's Barry!

  
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers

  
and an incapacitated flight crew.

  
Flowers?!

  
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls

  
with absolutely no flight experience.

  
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.

  
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.

  
They've done enough damage.

  
But isn't he your only hope?

  
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.

  
Their wings are too small...

  
Haven't we heard this a million times?

  
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."

  
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.

  
- Stand by.
- We're going live.

  
The way we work may be a mystery to you.

  
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.

  
But let me tell you about a small job.

  
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.

  
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.

  
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.

  
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.

  
We get behind a fellow.

  
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!

  
Left, right, down, hover.

  
- Hover?
- Forget hover.

  
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

  
Barry, what happened?!

  
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.

  
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!

  
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

  
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!

  
Move out!

  
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!

  
Don't have to yell.

  
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.

  
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!

  
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

  
I can't do this!

  
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!

  
You snap out of it.

  
You snap out of it.

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.

  
How is the plane flying?

  
I don't know.

  
Hello?

  
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?

  
The Pollen Jocks!

  
They do get behind a fellow.

  
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.

  
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.

  
Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?

  
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

  
Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.

  
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

  
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

  
Bring the nose down.

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.

  
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?

  
Affirmative!

  
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

  
Land on that flower!

  
Ready? Full reverse!

  
Spin it around!

  
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?

  
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!

  
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower

  
made of millions of bees!

  
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

  
Rotate around it.

  
- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.

  
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?

  
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!

  
Just drop it. Be a part of it.

  
Aim for the center!

  
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

  
Oome on, already.

  
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

  
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.

  
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?

  
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!

  
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.

  
Listen, everyone!

  
This runway is covered
with the last pollen

  
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.

  
That means this is our last chance.

  
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.

  
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?

  
Are we going to be bees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?

  
We're bees!

  
Keychain!

  
Then follow me! Except Keychain.

  
Hold on, Barry. Here.

  
You've earned this.

  
Yeah!

  
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.

  
Oh, yeah.

  
That's our Barry.

  
Mom! The bees are back!

  
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.

  
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!

  
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?

  
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

  
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!

  
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!

  
I had no idea.

  
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?

  
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.

  
Sorry I'm late.

  
He's a lawyer too?

  
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.

  
Have a great afternoon!

  
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.

  
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.

  
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?

  
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.

  
Thank you, Barry!

  
That bee is living my life!

  
Let it go, Kenny.

  
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.

  
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.

  
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.

  
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.

  
- Thinking bee!
- Me?

  
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.

  
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?

  
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!

  
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.

  
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.


 {Man} Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.

But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only 

be broken by love's first kiss.

She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing 

dragon.

Many brave knigts had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, 

but non prevailed.

She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest 

tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.

{Laughing} 

Like that's ever gonna happen.

{Paper Rusting, Toilet Flushes}

What a load of - 



Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

She was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb

In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

The years start comin' and they don't stop comin'

Fed to the rules and hit the ground runnin'

Didn't make sense not to live for fun

Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do so much to see

So what's wrong with takin' the backstreets

You'll never know if you don't go

You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now You're an all-star

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder

You're bundled up now but wait till you get older

But the meteor men beg to differ

Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin

The water's getting warm so you might as well swim

My world's on fire

How 'bout yours

That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

Hey, now, you're an all-star

{Shouting}

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold

{Belches}

Go!

Go!

{Record Scratching}

Go. Go.Go.

Hey, now, you're an all-star

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold



-Think it's in there?

-All right. Let's get it!

-Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

-Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.

{Laughs}

-Yes, well, actually, that would be a gaint.

Now, ogres - - They're much worse.

They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin.

-No!

-They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes!

Actually, it's quite good on toast.

-Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!

{Gasping}

-Right.

{Roaring}

{Shouting}

{Roaring}

{Whispers} This is the part where you run away.

{Gasping}

{Laughs}

{Laughing} And stay out!

"Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."

{Sighs}

{Man's voice} All right. This one's full.

-Take it away!

{Gasps}

-Move it along. Come on! Get up!

-Next!

-Give me that! Your fiying days are over.

That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!

-Get up! Come on!

-Twenty pieces.

{Thudding}

-Sit down there!

-Keep quiet!

{Crying}

-This cage is too small.

-Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again.

I can change. Please! Give me another chance!

-Oh, shut up.

-Oh!

-Next!

-What have you got?

-This little wooden puppet.

-I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy.

-Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.

-Father, please! Don't let them do this!

-Help me!

-Next! What have you got?

-Well, I've got a talking donkey.

{Grunts}

-Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it.

-Oh, go ahead, little fella.

-Well?

-Oh, oh, he's just - - He's just a little nervous.

He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt - -

-That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!

-No, no, he talks! He does. I can talk. I love to talk.

I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw.

-Get her out of my sight.

-No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

{Gasps}

-Hey! I can fly!

-He can fly!

-He can fly!

-He can talk!

-Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.

You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly

but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha!

Oh-oh.

{Grunts}

-Seize him!

-After him! He's getting away!

{Grunts, Gasps}

{Man}

-Get him! This way! Turn!

-You there. Orge!

-Aye?

-By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under 

arrest

and transport you to a designated..... resettlement facility.

-Oh, really? You and what army?

{Gasps, Whimpering}

{Chuckles}

-Can I say something to you?

-Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. 

Incredible!

Are you talkin' to - - me? Whoa!

-Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great 

back here? Those guards!

They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They 

was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made 

me feel good to see that.

-Oh, that's great. Really.

-Man, it's good to be free.

-Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? 

Hmm?

-But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by 

myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. 

You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit 

out of anybody that crosses us.

{Roaring}

-Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that 

don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you 

definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks!

You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time - - 

{Mumbling}

Than I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases eking out of my 

butt that day.

-Why are you following me?

-I'll tell you why. 



'Cause I'm all alone

There's no one here beside me

My promlems have all gone

There's no one to deride me

But you gotta heve friends - - 



-Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends.

-Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.

-Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?

-Uh - - Really tall?

-No! I'm an orge! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't 

that bother you?

-Nope.

-Really?

-Really, really.

-Oh.

-Man, I like you. What's you name?

-Uh, Shrek.

-Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek?

You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.

I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. Whoo! Look at that. 

Who'd want to live in place like that?

-That would be my home.

-Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a 

decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I 

like that boulder. That is a nice boulder.

-I guess you don't entertain much, do you?

-I like my privacy.

-You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I 

hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them 

a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence.

-Can I stay with you?

-Uh, what?

-Can I stay with you, please?

-Of course!

-Really?

-No.

-Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to 

be considered a freak. Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta 

stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!

-Okay! Okay! But one night only.

-Ah! Thank you!

-What are you - - No! No!

-This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, 

and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.

-Oh!

-Where do, uh, I sleep?

-Outside!

-Oh, well. I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you 

don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know.

{Sniffles}

-Here I go.

-Good night.

{Sighs}

-I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. 

I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, 

outside.



I'm all alone

There's no one here beside me

{Bubbling}

{Sighs}

{Creaking}

{Sighs}

-I thought I told you to stay outside.

-I'm outside.

{Clattering}

-Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we 

have? 

-It's not home, but it'll do just fune.

-What a lovely bed.

-Got ya.

{Sniffs} I found some cheese.

-Ow! {Grunts}

-Blah! Awful stuff.

-Is that you, Gorder?

-How did you know?

-Enough! What are you doing in my house?

{Grunts}

-Hey!

{Snickers}

-Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table.

-Where are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken.

-Huh?

{Gusps}

{Male voice} What?

-I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying orge! What do I 

have to do get a little privacy?

-Aah!

-Oh, no. No! No!

{Cackling}

-What?

-Quit it.

-Don't push.

{Squeaking}

{Lows}

- What are you doing in my swamp?

{Echoing}

Swamp! Swamp! Swamp!

{Gasping}

-Oh, dear!

-Whoa!

-All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! 

Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey!

-Quickly. Come on!

-No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there.

-Oh!

{Sighs}

-Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them.

-Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

-What?

-We were forced to come here.

-By who?

-Lord Farquaad.

-He huffed und he puffed und he...... signed an eviction notice.

{Sighs}

-All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?

{Murmuring}

-Oh, I do. I know where he is.

-Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all?

-Me! Me!

-Anyone?

-Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!

{Sighs}

-Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. 

Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy 

Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came 

from!

{Cheering}

{Twittering}

-Oh! You! You're comin' with me.

- All right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two 

stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it!

-On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek.

-Hey. Oh, oh!

-I can't wait to get on the road again.

-What did I say about singing?

-Can I whistle?

-No.

-Can I hum it?

-All right, hum it.

{Humming}



{Grunts}

{Whimpering}

-That's enough. He's ready to talk.

{Coughing}

{Laughing}

{Clears throat}

-Run, run, run, as fust as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the 

gingerbread man!

-You are a monster.

-I'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy 

tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the 

others?

-Eat me!{Grunts}

-I've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached 

its end! Tell me or I'll - -

-No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons.

-All right then. Who's hiding them?

-Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man?

-The muffin man?

-The muffin man.

-Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?

-Well, she's married to the muffin man.

-The muffin man?

-The muffin man!

-She's married to the muffin man.

{Door opens}

-My lord! We found it.

-Then what are you waiting for? Bring it in.

{Man grunting}

{Gasping}

-Oh!

-Magic mirror - - 

-Don't tell him anything!

-No!

{Ginerbread man whispers}

-Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect 

kingdom of them all?

-Well, technically you're not a king.

-Uh, Thelonius.

-You were saying?

-What I mean is, you're not a king yet. But you can become one.  All 

you have to do is marry a princess.

-Go on.

{Chuckles}

-So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to 

meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette 

number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. 

She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking 

and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella.

-Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of 

fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just 

kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come 

on. Give it up for Snow White!

-And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a 

fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling 

lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes 

pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, 

Princess Fiona!

-So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or 

bachelorette number three?

-Two! Two!

-Three! Three!

-Two! Two!

-Three! 

-Three? One?

{Shudders} Three?

--Three! Pick number three, my lord!

-Okay, okay, uh, number three!

-Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.



If you like pina coladas

And getting caught in the rain



-Princess Fiona.



If you're not into yoga



-She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go - - 

-But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night.

-I'll do it.

-Yes, but after sunset - -

-Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will 

finally have the perfect king!

Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament.



-But that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd 

find it.

-So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.

-Uh-huh. That's the place.

-Do you think maybe he's compensating for something?

{Laughs}

{Groans}

-Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

-Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.

-Hey, you!

{Screams}

-Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - -

{Whimpering}

{Sighs}

{Whimpering, Groans}

{Turnstile clatters}

{Chuckles}

{Sighs}

-It's quiet. Too quiet.

{Creaking}

-Where is everybody?

-Hey, look at this!

{Clattering, whirring, clicking}

Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town

Here we have some rules

Let us lay them down

Don't make waves, stay in line

And we'll get along fine

DuLoc is perfect place

Please keep off of the grass

Shine your shoes, wipe your... face

DuLoc is, DuLoc is

DuLoc is perfect ...... place

{Camera shutter clicks

{Whirring}

-Wow! Let's do that again!

-No. No. No, no, no! No.

{Trumpet fanfare}

{Crowd cheering}

-Brave knights.

-You are the best and brightest in all the land.

-Today one of you shall prove himself - -

-All right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom.

-Sorry about that.

{Cheering}

-That champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go 

forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the 

dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first 

runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you mae 

die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.

{Cheering}

-Let the tournament begin!

{Gasps}

-Oh!

-What is that?

{Gasping}

-It's hideous!

-Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey.

-Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the orge will be named 

champion! Have it him!

-Get him!

-Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now.

-Go ahead! Get him!

-Can't we just settle this over a pint?

-Kill the beast!

-No? All right then. Come on!



I don't give a damn about my reputation

You're living in the past 

It's a new generation



-Damn!

{Whinnying}



A girl can do what she wants to do

And that's what I'm gonna do

And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me

Me, me, me



-Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!



And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

Never said I wanted to improve my station



-Ah!

{Laughs}



And I'm always feelin' good when I'm having fun



-Yeah!



And I don't have to please no one



-The chair! Give him the chair!



And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me

Me, me, me

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me, not me

{Bell dings}

{Cheering}

{Laughs}

-Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till 

Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha!

{Shrek laughs}

{Crowd gasping, murmuring}

-Shall I give the order, sir?

-No, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion!

-What?

-Congratulations, orge. You're won the honor of embarking on a great 

and noble quest.

-Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back.

-Your swamp?

-Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those tale creatures!

{Crowd murmuring}

-Indeed. All right, orge. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for 

me, and I'll give you your swamp back.

-Exactly the way it was?

-Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.

-And the squatters?

-As good as gone.

-What kind of quest?

-Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a 

princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only 

don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place.

-Is that about right?

-Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.

-I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that orge stuff on 

him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make 

your bread, the whole orge trip.

-Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and 

put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and 

drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?

-Uh, no, not really, no.

-For your information, there's a lot more to orges than people think.

-Example?

-Example? Okay, um, orges are like onions.

-{Sniffs} They stink?

-Yes - - No!

-They make you cry?

-No!

-You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little 

white hairs.

-No! Layers! Onions have layers. Orges have layers! Onions have 

layers. You get it? We both have layers. 

{Sighs}

-Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes 

onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.

-I don't care... what everyone likes. Orges are not like cakes.

-You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a 

person, you say, "Let's get some parfait," they say, "No, I don't like 

no parfait"? Parfaits are delicious.

-No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Orges are like 

onions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.

-Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.

-You know, I think I preferred your humming. Do you have a tissure or 

something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start 

slobbering.



I'm on my way from misery to happiness today

Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

I'm on my way from misery to happiness today

Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

And everything that you receive up yonder

Is what you give to me the day I wander

I'm on my way 

I'm on my way 

I'm on my way 



-Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?

-You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was 

open. Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. {Sniffs} It's 

brimstone We must be getting close.

-Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I 

know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone 

neither.

{Rumbling}

-Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location.

{Laughing}

-Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said orges have layers?

-Oh, aye.

-Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have 

layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.

-Wait a second.  Donkeys don't have sleeves.

-You know what I mean.

-You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.

-I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over 

a boiling like of lava!

-Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional 

support., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step 

at a time.

-Really?

-Really, really.

-Okay, that makes me feel so much better.

-Just keep moving. And don't look  down.

-Okay, don't look  down. Don't look  down. Don't look  down. Keep on 

moving. Don't look  down.

{Gasps}

-Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, 

please! 

-But you're already halfway.

-But I know that half is safe!

-Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.

-Shrek, no! Wait!

-Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me?

-Don't do that!

-Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

-Oh, this?

-Yes, that!

-Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.

{Screams}

-No, Shrek! No! Stop it!

-You said do it! I'm doin' it.

-I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. Oh!

-That'll do, Donkey. That'll do.

-Cool.

-So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

-Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.

{Chuckles}

-I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.

{Water dripping, wind howling}

-You afraid?

-No.

-But - -

- Shh.

-Oh, good. Me neither.

{Gasps}

-'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible 

response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I 

might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and 

breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little 

scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that.

{Gasps}

-Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if 

you can find any stairs.

-Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess.

-The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest 

tower.

-What makes you think she'll be there?

-I read it in a book once.

-Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those 

stairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way 

they're goin'.

{Creacing}

-I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with 

me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a 

step right here. I'd step all over it.

-Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the - - 

-Dragon!

{Screams}

{Gasps}

{Roars}

-Donkey, look out!

{Screams}

{Whimpering}

-Got ya!

{Roars}

{Gasps}

{Shouts}

-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

{Screaming}

{Gasps}

-Oh! Aah! Aah!

{Gasping}

{Crowls}

-No. Oh, no, No!

{Screams}

-Oh, what large teeth you have.

{Crowls}

-I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all time 

from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile 

you got  there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know 

what else? You're - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of 

course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking of feminine beauty. 

What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ohh. Oh. 

Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh - - 

(Coughs)

-I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna 

blow smoke rings. Shrek!

{Gasps}

{Whimpering}

-No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

{Groans, Sighs}

{Vocalizing}

-Oh! Oh!

-Wake up!

-What?

-Are you Princess Fiona?

-I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.

-Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

-But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be 

a wonderful, romantic moment?

-Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.

-Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should sweep me off my feet out 

yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed.

-You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?

-Mm-hmm.

{Screams, grunts}

-But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for 

me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!

-I don't think so.

-Can I at least know the name of my champion?

-Um, Shrek.

-Sir Shrek.

{Cleans throat}

-I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.

-Thanks!

{Roaring}

-You didn't slay the dragon?

-It's on my to-do list. Now come on!

{Screams}

-But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, 

banner flying. That's what all the other knights did.

-Yeah, right before they burst into flame.

-That's not the point. Oh!

-Wait. Where are you going? The next's over there.

-Well, I have to save my ass.

-What kind of knight are you?

-One of a kind.

-Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to 

know someone over a long perriod of time. Just call me old-fashioned. 

{Laughs}

-I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not 

emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - -  Magnitude really 

is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that is unwanted 

physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back 

up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to 

know each other first as friends or pen pals. I'm on the road a lot, 

but I just love receiving cards - -  I'd really love to stay, but - - 

Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna 

tear it off. I don't give permission - - What are you gonna do with 

that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh!

{Growls}

{Roaring}

{Gasps}

-Hi, Princess!

-It talks!

-Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick.

{Screams}

{Screaming}

-Oh!

{Thuds}

{Groans}

{Roars}

{Roaring}

-Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll take care of the dragon.

{Fchoing}

-Run!

{Gasping}

{Screaming}

{Roaring}

{Screams}

{Roars}

{Panting, sighs}

{Whimpers}

{Roars}

-You did it!

-You rescued me! You're amazing. You're - - You're wonderful. 

You're... a little unorthodox I'll admit. But they deed is great, and 

thine heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt. 

{Clears throat}

-And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?

-I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a 

steed.

-The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.

-Uh, no.

-Why not?

-I have helmet hair.

-Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.

-No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.

-But how will you kiss me?

-What? That wasn't in the job description.

-Maybe it's a perk.

-No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in 

a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then 

they share true love's first kiss.

-Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is you 

true love?

-Well, yes.

{Laughing}

-You think Shrek is your true love!

-What is so funny?

-Let's just say I'm not your tipe, okay?

-Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your 

helmet.

-Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.

-Just take off the helmet.

-I'm not going to.

-Take ot off.

-No!

-Now!

-Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.

-You- - You're a- - an orge.

-Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.

-Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed 

to be an orge.

{Sighs}

-Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the 

one who wants to marry you.

-Then why didn't he come rescue me?

-Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.

-But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some prge and his- - 

his pet.

-So much for noble steed.

-You're not making my job any easier.

-I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad 

that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right 

here.

-Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy.

-You wouldn't dare. Put me down!

-Ya comin', Donkey?

-I'm right behind ya.

-Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not 

dignified! Put me down!

-Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, 

right, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down 

real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a 

crisp and eaten?

-You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knowest what 

happens when you find your - -  Hey!

{Sighs}

-The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.

-You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!

-And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

-Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in 

short supply.

{Laughs}

-I don't know. There are those who think little of him.

-Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never 

measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

-Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. But I'll let you do the 

"measuring" when you see him tomorrow.

-Tomorrow? It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop to make camp?

-No, that'll take longer. We can keep going.

-But there's robbers in the woods.

-Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping's starting to sound good.

-Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this 

forest.

-I need to find somewhere to camp now!

{Birds wings fluttering}

{Grunting}

-Hey! Over here.

-Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a 

princess.

-No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.

-Homey touches? Like what?

{Crashing}

-A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.

-You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will.

-I said good night!

-Shrek, What are you doing?

{Laughs}

-I just- - You know - - Oh, come on. I was just kidding.

{Fire cracking}

-And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only orge to ever spit over 

three wheat fields. Right. Yeah.

-Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?

-The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, 

there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for.

-I know you're making this up.

-No, look. There he is,  and there's the group of hunters running away 

from his stench.

-That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.

-You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? 

Forget it.

{Sighs}

-Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?

-Our swamp?

-You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.

-We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's no "our". There's just me and my 

swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall arond my 

land.

-You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what 

I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody 

out.

-No, do ya think?

-Are you hidin' something?

-Never mind, Donkey.

-Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?

-No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things.

-Why don't you want to talk about it?

-Why do you want to talk about it?

-Why are you blocking?

-I'm not blocking.

-Oh, yes, you are.

-Donkey, I'm warning you.

-Who you trying to keep out?

-Everyone! Okay?

-Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere.

-Oh! For the love of Pete!

-What's your problem? What you got against the whole world anyway?

-Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that 

seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go. 

"Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly orge!" They judge me before they 

even know me. That's why I'm better off alone.

-You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, 

stupid, ugly orge.

-Yeah, I know.

-So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?

-Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying.

-Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one 

there?

-That's the moon.

-Oh, okay.



{Orchestra}

{Dulcimer}

-Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the 

princess.

-Hmph.

-Ah. Perfect.

{Inhales}



{Snoring}

{Sniffs, yawns}

-Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that.

--Come on, baby. I said I like it.

-Donkey, wake up.

-Huh? What?

-Wake up.

-What?

-Good morning. Hm, how do you like your eggs?

-Good morning, Princess!

-What's all this about?

-You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to 

make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me.

-Uh, thanks.

{Sniffs}

-Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us.

{Belches}

-Shrek!

-What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. {Laughs}

-Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess.

{Belches}

-Thanks.

-She's as nasty as you are.

-{Laughs} You know, you're not exactly what I expected.

-Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them.

{Vocalizing}



-La liberte! Hey!

-Princess!

{Laughs}

-What are you doing?

-Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! And I am rescuing you from 

this green - -

{Kissing sounds}

-beast.

-Hey!

-That's my princess! Go find you own!

-Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a little busy here?

-Look, pal, I don't know who you think you are!

-Oh! Of couse! Oh, how rude. Please let me introduse myself. Oh, Merry 

Men. 

{Laughs}

Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.

I steal from the rich and give to the needy.

He takes a wee percentage, 

But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty damsels

Man, I'm good

What a guy, Monsieur Hood

Break it down

I like an honest fight

and a saucy little maid

What he's basically saying

is he likes to get - - 

Paid

So

When an orge in the bush

grabs a lady by the tush

That's bad

That's bad

When a beauty's with a beast

it makes me awfully mad

He's mad

He's really, really mad

I'll take my blade and

ram it through your heart

Keep your eyes on me, boys

'cause I'm about to start



{Grunts, Groans}

{Karate Yell}

{Merry Men Gasping}

{Panting}

-Man, that was annoying!

-Oh, you little- - 

{Karate Yell}

{Accordion}

{Shouting, groaning}

{Chuckles}

-Uh, shall we?

-Hold the phone.

{Grunts}

Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come from?

-What?

-That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that?

-Well - - {Chuckles} When one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these 

things in case there's a - - There's an arrow in your butt!

-What? Oh, would you look at that?

-Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.

-Why? What's wrong?

-Shrek's hurt.

-Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.

-Donkey, I'm okay.

-You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep 

you legs elevated. Turn your head and cough. Does anyone know the 

Heimlich?

-Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and 

find me a blue flower with red thorns.

-Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. 

Don't die Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!

-{Both} Donkey!

-Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.

-What are the flowers for?

-For getting rid of Donkey.

-Ah.

-Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out.

-Ow! Hey! Easy with the yankin'.

-I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

-No, it's tender.

-Now, hold on.

-What you're doing is the opposite of help.

-Don't move.

-Look, time out.

-Would you - - 

{Grunts}

-Okay. What do you propose we do?

-Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red 

thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind! Blue 

flower, red thorns.

-Ow!

-Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'!

-Ow! Not good.

-Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head.

{Grunts}

-It's just about - - 

-Ow! Ohh!

-Ahem.

-Nothing happend. We were just, uh - - 

-Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask. Okay?

-Oh, come on! That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was 

just- - Ugh! 

-Ow!

-Hey, what's that?

{Nervous chickle}

-That's- - Is that blood?

{Sighs}

{Bird chirping}

{Grunts}



My beloved monster and me

We go everywhere together

Wearin' a raincoat

that has four sleeves

Gets us through all kinds of weather



-Aah!



She will always be the only thing

That comes between me and the awful sting

That comes from living in a world

that's so damn mean

{Croaks}

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

-Hey!

La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la

{Both laughing}

La-la, la-la, la-la



-There it is, Princess. Your future awaits you.

-That's DuLoc?

-Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for 

something,  which I think means he has a really - - Ow!

-Um, I, uh- -  I guess we better move on.

-Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried about Donkey.

{Blubbering}

-What?

-I mean, look at him. He doesn't look so good. 

-What are you talking about? I'm fine.

-That's what they always say, and then next thing you know, you're on 

your back. Dead.

-You know, she's right. You look awful. Do you want to sit down?

-Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.

-I didn't want to say nothin', but I got this twinge in my neck, and 

when I turn my head like this, look, 

{Bones crunch}

-Ow! See?

-Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.

-I'll get the firewood.

-Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't feel my toes! I don't have any 

toes! I think I need a hug.



-Mmm. This is good. This is really good. What is this?

-Uh, weedrat. Rotisserie style.

-No kidding. Well, this is delicious.

-Well, they're also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I 

make a mean weedrat stew.

{Chuckling}

{Sighs}

-I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night.

{Gulps}

-Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kind 

of stuff for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - you name it.

{Chuckles}

-I'd like that.

{Slurps, laughs}



See the pyramids along the Nile



-Um, Princess?



Watch the sunrise from a tropic isle



-Yes, Shrek?

-I, um, I was wondering.



Just remember, darling all the while



-Are you- - 



You belong to me



{Sighs} 

-Are you gonna eat that?

{Chuckles}

-Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset.

-Sunset?

-Oh, no! I mean, it's late. I-It's very late.

-What?

-Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here. You're afraid of the dark, 

aren't you?

-Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know, I'd better go inside.

-Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until 

- - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.

{Shrek sighs}

 -Good night.

 -Good night.

{Door creaks}

-Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on here.

-Oh, what are you talkin' about?

-I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. 

And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it.

-You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

-Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones. Just go on in 

and tell her how you feel.

-I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, 

well, you know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause I don't - - she's a 

princess, and I'm - - 

-An orge?

-Yeah. An orge.

-Hey, where you goin'?

-To get... move firewood.

{Sighs} 



-Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you?

{Wings fluttering}

-Princess?

{Creaking}

{Gasps}

-It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games.

{Screams}

-Aah!

-Oh, no!

-No, help!

-Shh!

-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

-No, it's okay. It's okay.

-What did you do with the princess?

-Donkey, I'm the princess.

-Aah!

-It's me, in this body.

-Oh, my God! You ate the princess. Can you hear me?

-Donkey!

-Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there!

-No!

-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

-Shh.

-Shrek!

-This is me.

{Muffled mumbling}

-Princess? What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different.

-I'm ugly, okay?

-Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats 

was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now - - 

-No.

-I - - I've been this way as long as I can remember.

-What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before.

-It's only happens when sun goes down.

"By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm... until you 

find true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form."

-Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.

-It's a spell.

{Sighs} 

-When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I 

become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to 

await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry 

Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this.

{Sobs}

-All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not 

that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look 

like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7.

-But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant 

to look.

-Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?

-I have to.  Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.

-But, you know, um, you're kind of an orge, and Shrek - - well, you 

got a lot in common.

-Shrek?



-Princess, I - - Uh, how's it going, first of all? Good? Um, good for 

me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's 

pretty and - - well, I don't really like it, but I thought you might 

like it 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd - - uh, uh - 

- 

{Sighs}

-I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.

-I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I 

mean, really, who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly? 

"Princess" and "ugly" don't go together. That's why I can't stay here 

with Shrek.

{Gasps}

-My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.

{Deep sigh}

-Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only 

way to break the spell.

-You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.

-No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.

-What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?

-Promise you won't tell. Promise!

-All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. I just know 

before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy.

-Look at my eye twitchin'.

{Door opens}

{Snoring}

-I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him. 

-Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want - - 

{Snoring}

-Shrek. Are you all right?

-Perfect! Never been better.

-I - - I don't - - There's something I have to tell you.

-You don't have to tell me anything, Princess. I heard enough last 

night.

-You heard what I said?

-Every word.

-I thought you'd understand.

-Oh, I undersatnd. Like you said, "Who could love a hideous, ugly 

beast?" 

-But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.

-Yeah? Well, it does.

{Gasps, sighs}

-Ah, right on time.

{Horse whinnies}

-Princess, I've brought you a little something.

{Fanfare}

{Yawns}

-What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

{Muffled}

-Who said that? Couldn't have been a donkey.

-Princess Fiona.

-As promised. Now hand it over.

-Very well, orge. The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed.

-Take it and go before I change my mind.

-Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I 

have never seen such a radiant beauty before. I'm Lord Farquaad.

-Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no.

{Snaps fingers}

-Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying a short... farewell.

-Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the 

orge. It's not like it has feelings.

-No, you're right. It doesn't.

-Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawerss Fiona. I ask your hand in 

marriage.

{Gasps}

-Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?

-Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make - - 

-Excellent! I'll start the plans, for tomorrow we wed!

-No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get married today before the sun 

sets.

-Oh, anxious, are you? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's 

so much to do! Threre's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest 

list. Captain, round up some guests!

-Fare-thee-well, orge.

-Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away.

-Yeah? So what?

-Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. Look, I talked to 

her last night, She's - - 

-I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? 

Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?

-Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.

-I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! 

My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, 

pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!

-But I thought - - 

-Yeah. You know what? You tought wrong!

-Shrek.



I heard there was a secret chord

That David played and it pleased the Lord

But you don't really care for music, do ya

It goes like this the fourth, the fifth

The minor fall the major lift

The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah,  hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before

I know this room I've walked this floor

I used to live alone before I knew you

I've seen your flag on the marble arch

But love is not a victory march

It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah,  hallelujah

And all I ever learned from love

Is how to shoot at someone

Who outdrew you

{Moaning}

And it's not a cry you can hear at night

It's not somebody who's seen the light

It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

{Moaning}

Hallelujah,  hallelujah



{Thumping sound}

-Donkey?

{Grunts}

-What are you doing?

-I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see 

one.

-Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not 

through it.

-It is around your half. See that's your half, and this is my half.

-Oh! Your half. Hmm.

-Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I 

get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks 

like your head.

-Back off!

-No, you back off.

-This is my swamp!

-Our swamp.

-Let go, Donkey!

-You let go.

-Stubborn jackass!

-Smelly orge.

-Fine!

-Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet.

-Well, I'm through with you.

-Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, "Me, me, me!" Well, guess 

what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are 

mean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! 

You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.

-Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?

-Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!

-Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... for stabbin' me in 

the back!

-Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your 

own feelings.

-Go away!

-There you are , doing it again just like you did to Fiona. All she 

ever do was like you, maybe even love you.

-Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of 

you talking. 

-She wasn't talkin' about you. She was talkin' about, uh, somebody 

else.

-She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about?

-Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me. 

Right? Right?

-Donkey!

-No!

-Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right?

{Sighs}

-I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly orge. Can you 

forgive me?

-Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

-Right. Friends?

-Friends.

-So, um, what did Fiona say about me?

-What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?

-The wedding! We'll never make it in time.

-Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a way and I 

have a way.

{Whistles}

-Donkey?

-I guess it's just my animal magnetism.

{Laughing}

-Aw, come here, you.

-All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. 

All right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't had a chance to install 

the seat belts yet.

-Whoo!

{Bells tolling}

{All gasping}

-People of DuLoc, we gather here today to bear witnss to the union....

-Um-

-of our new king - -

-Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"?

{Chuckling}

-Go on.

-Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about 

that? Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't 

you?

-What are you talking about?

-There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, "Speak 

now or forever hold your peace." That's when you say, "I object!"

-I don't have time for this!

-Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this 

woman, don't you?

-Yes.

-You wanna hold her?

-Yes.

-Please her?

-Yes!

-Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness. The chicks love that 

romantic crap!

-All right! Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?

-We gotta check it out.



-And so, by the power vested in me, 

-What do you see?

-The whole town's in there.

-I now pronounce you husband and wife,

-They're at the altar.

-king and queen.

-Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

-Oh, for the love of Pete!

{Grunts}

-I object!

-Shrek?

{Gasps}

-Oh, now what does he want?

-Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first at all. 

Very clean.

-What are you doing here?

-Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but 

showing up uninvited to a wedding - -

-Fiona! I need to talk to you.

-Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little late for that, so if you'll 

excuse me - - 

-But you can't marry him.

-And why not?

-Because- - Because he's just marring you so he can be king.

-Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.

-He's not your true love.

-And what do you know about true love?

-Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - - 

-Oh, this is precious. The orge has fallen in love with the princess! 

Oh, good Lord.

{Crowd laughting}

-An orge and a princess!

-Shrek, is this true?

-Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away 

from our "happily ever after." Now kiss me! Mmmmm!

-"By night one way, by day another." I wanted to show you before.

{Whimpers}

{Crown gasping}

-Well, uh, that explains a lot.

-Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! I order you to get that out of 

my sight now! Get them! Get them both!

-No, no!

-Shrek!

-This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that 

makes me king! See? See?

-No, let go of me! Shrek!

-No!

-Don't just stand there, you morons.

-Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh! 

-I'll make you regret the day we met. I'll see you drawn and 

quartered!

-You'll beg for death to save you!

-No, Shrek!

-And as for you, my wife,

-Fiona!

-I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days!

-I'm king!

{Whistles}

-I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have - - Aaaah!

-Aah!

-All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to 

use it.

{Roars}

-I'm a donkey on the edge!

{Belches}

-Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?

{Cheering}

-Go ahead, Shrek.

-Uh, Fiona?

-Yes, Shrek?

-I - - I love you.

-Really?

-Really, really.

- I love you too.

-Aawww!

-"Until you find true love's first kiss and then take love's true 

form."

-"Take love's true form. Take love's true form."

-Fiona? Fiona. Are you all right?

-Well, yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful.

-But you ARE beautiful.

{Chuckles}

-I was hoping this would be a happy ending.



I thought love was only true in fairy tales

Oy!

Meant for someone else but not for me

Love was out to get me

That's the way it seemed

Disappointment haunted all my dreams

And then I saw her face

Now I'm a believer and not a trace

Of doubt in my mind

I'm in love

Ooh-aah

I'm a believer I couldn't leave her

If I tried



-God bless us, every one.



Come on, y'all!

Then I saw her face

-Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh.

-I can't breathe. I can't breathe. 



I believe in self-assertion

Destiny or a slight diversion

Now it seems I've got my head on straight

I'm a freak an apparition

Seems I've made the right decision

To try to turn back now it might be too late



Now I want to stay home today

Don't wanna go out

If anyone comes to play

Gonna get thrown out

I wanna stay home today

Don't want no company

No way

Yeah, yeah, yeah



I wanna be a millionaire someday

But know what it feels like to give it away

Watch me march to the beat of my own drum

And it's off to the moon and then back again

Same old day Same situation

My happiness rears back as if to say



I wanna stay home today

Don't wanna go out

If anyone comes to play

Gonna get thrown out

I wanna stay home today

Don't want no company

No way

Yeah, yeah, yeah



I wanna stay home, stay home, stay home.........

Oh, girl, I'm so thankful

that you are still mine

You always consider me

I break a little something

to keep my mind on

'Cause you had my mind gone

What's a girl to do 

I'm telling you

You're on my mind

I wanna be with you

'Cause when you're

standin' next to me

It's like wow

And all your kisses

seem to set me free

It's like wow

And when we touch

it's such a rush

I can't get enough

It's like- - It's like

Ooh-ooh

Hey, what

It's like wow

Ooh-ooh, hey

Hey, yeah

It's like wow

Everything is looking

Is like wow



There is something

that I see

In the way 

you look at me

There's a smile

There's a truth

In your eyes

What an unexpected way

On this unexpected day

Could it be

This is where I belong

It is you I have loved

All long

There's no more mystery

It is finally clear to me

You're the home

my heart's searched for

So long

It is you I have loved

All long

Whoa, over and over

I'm filled with emotion

As I look

Into your perfect face

It's going. It's going.

  
And it's gone.

  
Whatever.

  
Maybe we should take a break.

  
That's it. I can't take this anymore.

  
I can't. I give up.

  
I'm sick of struggling for survival.

  
Competing with gophers and
earthworms and that loser sparrow...

  
...who always takes my nuts.

  
And I'm especially sick of this stupid...

  
...stupid tree.

  
-What's happening?
-Guys.

  
I think he made it angry.

  
I'm awake.

  
I'm up...

  
...and I'm late.

  
Demo. Dave Seville.

  
Keys. Bag.

  
Pants.

  
I need pants. Pants are essential.

  
Claire.

  
-Dave.
-Hey.

  
How's it going?

  
I haven't seen you since....

  
Well, since you said you never wanted
to see me again.

  
So I guess it worked.

  
What a fun day that was.

  
Let me guess.
You're late for something again.

  
-Same old Dave.
-Not following you.

  
You know,
the guy who's always fooling around...

  
...who can't handle
a serious relationship.

  
That was the old Dave.

  
How about we get together,
talk about the new Dave?

  
Tomorrow night. My place.

  
-I....
-Great.

  
-No--
-You look good, Claire.

  
Where are we?

  
Well, I think they remodeled our forest.
I like it. Stylish, yet functional.

  
Where did the mountains go?

  
Give me a break.
We're in a building, Theodore.

  
Dave.

  
-Ian.
-Hey, big guy.

  
Hey, you ever seen the view
from the 80th floor?

  
-No. They never let me past the lobby.
-What? I can't....

  
Hey, back off, man,
this is Dave Seville.

  
Mr. Seville, can I offer you
some muffins, scones, pastries?

  
No. I'd hate to be a bother.

  
It's no problem.
We have an omelet station.

  
Omelet station.

  
Can I get you some water
or a soy latte?

  
How about a shot
of wheatgrass juice?

  
Maybe later. Thanks.

  
let's talk about your song, Dave.

  
Well, as crazy as it sounds...

  
-...the original inspiration came to me--
-The song sucks, Dave.

  
-What?
-Your song? It's awful. I hate it.

  
You know, I mean, who's gonna sing it?
Justin, Fergie? Not a chance.

  
I need something new.
I need something fresh.

  
-That is new.
-The next big thing.

  
Dave, we go way back, all right?

  
And we've both come a long way
since college. You? Not so much.

  
I wanted to like that song,
but you heard it. Not that good.

  
If I wasn't your friend,
I'd say:

  
''Dave, you go right back
out of this office...

  
...and you keep writing music.
You'll get there someday.''

  
But I am your friend,
so I'm going to tell you...

  
...that there is no sense
in writing songs...

  
...that no one is ever,
ever going to sing.

  
Ever?

  
Excuse me.

  
Can I get some of that water?

  
We ran out.

  
Hey!

  
-Out of the way.
-Alvin...

  
-...slow down.
-Move your butt, Theodore.

  
You stepped on my tail.

  
Last one to the door is roadkill.

  
I'm in.

  
What are these shiny things?

  
Theodore, we're leaving now.

  
Okay, this wasn't my best idea.
Look out!

  
Maniac!

  
Back to tree. Back to tree.

  
Back to the dog. Back to the dog!

  
-Basket! Three o'clock.
-Which way is 3 o'clock?

  
-This way.
-Guys, wait for me.

  
Wait up.
I still have baby fat, you know.

  
-Jump. You've gotta really want it.
-I want it.

  
-I want it.
-I can't hang like this all day.

  
Will you jump already?

  
Muffins.

  
Gross. Is this his house?

  
No. It's his garbage can.

  
This must be where he stores
his food for winter.

  
As it came down to one--

  
Boa has the mouse trapped on a branch
with no way out.

  
As the boa moves in for the attack...

  
...the mouse
seems to be facing certain death.

  
The boa's sensitive tongue
tastes the victim's presence.

  
The mouse crashes
through the foliage.

  
Come on, baby. Come to papa!

  
Hello, gorgeous.

  
We've hit the mother lode.

  
--tropical rainforest
where food is bountiful.

  
This is the greatest day of my life.

  
Eureka! I found the cheese balls.

  
Alvin, what are you doing?
Don't make a mess.

  
Cannonball.

  
Quick. Hide.

  
Hurry, you guys.

  
Did I put these here?

  
There you are. I got you.

  
He's been out for quite a while.

  
You guys, he's dead.

  
Don't panic. Wipe everything down.

  
I need three garbage bags, a shovel,
some disinfectant...

  
...some latex gloves and oregano, go!

  
Hang on, Sherlock. He's coming to.

  
I must be hearing things.

  
Oh, this is trippy.

  
Sir, are you all right?

  
Get back!

  
Squirrels can't talk.

  
Hey.

  
Watch it, genius.

  
We are chipmunks. Chipmunks.

  
Chipmunks can't talk either.

  
Our lips are moving
and words are coming out.

  
This is not happening.

  
I am not talking to chipmunks.
I am not talking to chipmunks.

  
So how's that working for you, Dave?

  
How do you know my name?

  
I'll field that one.
We read your mail. By accident.

  
You really ought to pay
that utility bill, Dave.

  
-You ever heard of a credit rating?
-What's this thing?

  
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Stop doing-- Turn that off.

  
Sorry.

  
He fell out of the tree at birth.

  
Can all animals talk?

  
Well, I believe fish
have this type of sign language.

  
Hey, Dave, do all humans have houses
that smell like sweat socks?

  
Dave likes to wear

  
Dirty underwear with little hairs

  
We're getting off on the wrong foot.

  
Allow us to introduce ourselves.

  
Hello, I'm Simon, the smart one.

  
-He's Alvin.
-The awesomest one.

  
And I'm Theodore.

  
Oh, nice to meet you.
Now get out of my house.

  
But we talk.

  
Which makes me want you
out of my house that much more.

  
It's creepy. Unnatural. Somewhat evil.

  
I kind of liked him better
when he was unconscious.

  
-Gotcha.
-Hey.

  
Don't do this, Dave.

  
We can gnaw right through this door.

  
Hi.

  
Oh, were we disturbing you?

  
What, you guys can sing too?

  
That's not singing. This is singing.

  
This is amazing.

  
Here, everyone inside.

  
-There you go.
-Thank you.

  
All right, here's the deal.

  
You guys sing my songs,
you get to sleep here.

  
No. Wait. Is breakfast included?

  
I can live with that.

  
What about TV privileges?

  
Okay, but not after 7.

  
-Eight.
-Done.

  
But don't tell your animal friends,
because I don't wanna come home...

  
...and find rabbits
and skunks on my couch.

  
Filthy creatures, Dave.
Never associate with them.

  
Yeah, you're our only friend.

  
No, no, no.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.

  
Let's just start with me
being your songwriter.

  
Let me ask you.
Have you ever written a song before?

  
-Yup.
-And is that your music stuff outside?

  
Yup.

  
Oh, no!

  
Hurry back.

  
So, fellas, all we gotta do
is find the right song, rehearse--

  
-Hey, Dave.
-Simon.

  
My bad.

  
This is my sheet music.

  
Alvin.

  
This is not a Hula-Hoop.
It's a towel rack.

  
-Killjoy.
-Are you guys always like this?

  
We're kids, Dave.

  
Well, where are your parents?

  
When you're a chipmunk, your parents
take care of you for a week.

  
Then they take off.

  
Our parents were hippies.
They left early to join a commune.

  
-I am Robert the Robot.
-Help! Crazy robot. Help! It's after me!

  
-It's after me.
-Hey. Hey. Be careful with that.

  
-Sorry.
-It's a collectible.

  
-I got it for Christmas last year.
-Christmas! We love Christmas.

  
Even though we've never
actually celebrated it.

  
But we want to.

  
Yeah, you can never go wrong
with Christmas.

  
Oh, maybe we can celebrate it
with you.

  
Yeah, maybe.

  
Look, I've had a long and weird day,
so off to bed.

  
Come on.

  
We start work tomorrow.

  
I want you bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed by 8.

  
My tail isn't bushy till 9.

  
Not my problem. Now go to sleep.

  
I hope Christmas comes fast.

  
Me too.

  
Want a plane that loops the loop?

  
Loop.

  
Hoop.

  
Hula-Hoop.

  
Here's trouble. Fire in the hole!

  
What are you guys doing?

  
Nothing. What are you doing?

  
Stand back, Dave. She's gonna blow!

  
I got it. I got it, guys. Come to papa.

  
-Hey. Where did it go?
-Simon, this landed right in front of you.

  
You didn't see it?

  
How many fingers am I holding up?

  
Four. No, no, no.
Eight? Counting your thumb?

  
-Wait, wait, wait--
-Hang on a second.

  
Six. Final answer is six.

  
Try these.

  
How's that?

  
Someone trashed your house.

  
It was clean

  
Well, we colored for a while,
but then we got hungry.

  
Wanna see what we colored?

  
Actually, I wanna play you
something.

  
I wrote a song
for you guys to sing, so let's--

  
We've put a few toaster waffles
aside for winter.

  
And we're not sharing.

  
Guys, we're gonna have food all winter,
so if you start storing it...

  
...it's gonna get gross
and we're gonna have rodent....

  
Bad, you know,
non-talking rodents around here.

  
Let's go. Let's get to work.

  
All right, you chipmunks.
Ready to sing your song?

  
-I'll say we are.
-Yeah. Let's sing it now.

  
-Ready, Simon?
-Okay.

  
-Ready, Theodore?
-Okay.

  
Alvin?

  
Alvin?

  
This kicks a hamster wheel's butt.

  
Alvin!

  
Okay!

  
Christmas, Christmastime is near

  
Time for toys and time for cheer

  
We've been good, but we can't last

  
Hurry, Christmas, hurry fast

  
Want a plane that loops the loop

  
Me, I want a Hula-Hoop

  
We can't hardly stand the wait

  
Please, Christmas, don't be late

  
What?

  
Dave Seville's in the lobby.

  
He says he won't leave
without seeing you.

  
That loser again?

  
-Dave.
-Ian.

  
-Okay.
-I've got something for you.

  
-It's your next big thing.
-Dave.

  
Don't say anything.

  
What the...?

  
Dave, don't do this to yourself, man.

  
They sing.

  
No. They don't.

  
They do. Just give me a second.

  
Come on, guys.

  
Want a plane that loops the loop

  
Me, I want a Hula-Hoop

  
You know, Dave...

  
...some people might say
it's kind of weird...

  
...that a grown man
would want a Hula-Hoop.

  
And others would say,
''You know what's weirder than that?

  
A grown man bringing
another grown man...

  
...a big box
with a bunch of chipmunks in it...

  
...who not only speak English
but can sing.''

  
They do sing.
We've been practicing all morning.

  
Oh, you've been practicing.
I never realized. Okay, well.

  
Yeah. Okay, no.
Dave, I'm going to pretend...

  
...that I have a lunch to go to.

  
I've got a lunch to go to.

  
What was that?

  
Nothing. Nothing.
Just a little stage fright.

  
I thought my heart
was gonna explode.

  
We're not performing monkeys.

  
Why do we have to sing
for that guy?

  
Well, how's this?

  
Pretend I need the money
and I hate my job...

  
...and you're staying at my place,
so you owe me.

  
We're sorry, Dave.

  
Yeah, that helps.

  
Never mind. I'm late for work.

  
Can we go with you?

  
What, so you can mess that up too?

  
You're going home.

  
Can I stand in your lap and steer?

  
Oh, can we at least beep the horn?

  
Never mind.

  
So sorry about the delay.
It should be a couple more minutes.

  
But we're building the suspense.

  
-Here he is.
-Sorry I'm late.

  
Boy, am I jazzed about our
Yum-able Energy Bars commercial.

  
That's Good-able Energy Bar
commercial.

  
Right, Good-able.

  
Okay, here's the pitch.

  
We open on a group of lethargic kids.

  
Close-up on a little girl's face.
She's sad.

  
Our customers don't like to think
of their kids as being sad.

  
Could she be flying a kite?

  
I like kites.

  
Good.

  
Okay, great. She's flying a kite.

  
She's running with a kite.
She's running out of steam.

  
She's tired and lets go of the kite.

  
Oh, no. We see her face, it's sad.

  
-But not too sad.
-Right.

  
So she pulls out
her Good-able Energy Bar--

  
It's my mom. Sorry.

  
-Hi, Mom.
-A little situation, Dave.

  
Theodore vacuumed up Alvin.

  
-Alvin.
-Dave, help!

  
-What?
-At least it wasn't the garbage disposal.

  
Just stay calm.

  
And there goes Theodore.

  
Look, I can't do this right now, okay?

  
I absolutely understand but--
Sorry, Dave?

  
Quick question.

  
How do you feel about an indoor pool?

  
Look, if you flood my house,
you're dead.

  
Out on the street, capiche?

  
Mothers.

  
Why don't we come over here
and look at the sales projections?

  
You know, when I first saw these
numbers, I thought there's just no way...

  
...but then I looked again.

  
The ''size of Theodore's butt''?

  
Why don't we come back to that?

  
Anyway, 10 years ago, the market share
for healthy food snacks...

  
...was imperceptible
among 6- to 12-year-olds.

  
''How smart Simon thinks he is''?

  
Yeah, as opposed to
how smart he actually is.

  
Who's Simon?

  
-I didn't--
-Just move it along.

  
You know what?
I think I'll just clean out my office.

  
Sounds good.

  
SpongeBob. You're 15 minutes late.

  
Sorry, Mr. Krabs,
I was out all night looking for Gary.

  
He got away. Well....

  
Guys. What's this about?

  
Obviously, Theodore's butt.

  
We told you we colored.

  
On my presentation boards?
You got me fired.

  
We didn't know.

  
-We're sorry, Dave.
-Oh, you're sorry? That's fantastic.

  
Sorry doesn't get my job back, now,
does it, Theodore?

  
Why are my clothes all over the place?

  
We used them to mop up the water.
Good idea, right?

  
Oh, my God. Theodore, did you just--?

  
It's a raisin, Dave.

  
Prove it.

  
Okay, you got me.

  
I wanna talk to all you guys.
Where's Alvin?

  
-Alvin?
-You owe me bigtime.

  
Alvin.

  
Come on. Come on.

  
There's this new thing.
It's called knocking.

  
-Get out.
-I'm waiting for the rinse cycle.

  
-Out.
-I'm taking a shower here.

  
You know,
if I made a list of my worst days ever...

  
...today would be at the top
of the list.

  
And it's still early.

  
Clam it, sudsy.

  
Okay. Guys, let me just put it
to you like this, okay?

  
I have no job, no career, my house
is always a mess. Thank you very much.

  
Hi, Dave. It's Claire Wilson calling.
And why did I just say my last name?

  
That was weird. I guess I'm just a little
nervous about coming over for dinner.

  
-Dinner.
-So, yeah. I'm gonna hang up now.

  
I'll be there at 7. Okay. Bye.

  
That's half an hour.

  
Who's Claire?

  
Claire is Dave's mate.

  
She is not my mate.

  
She's my ex-mate.

  
Okay. This is great.

  
Dave. Dave, relax.

  
You just go get the food.
We'll take care of the rest.

  
Why am I having a hard time
believing you?

  
That hurts, Dave. That really hurts.

  
-Yeah. We're all in this together, Dave.
-Like a family.

  
No. Not like a family.

  
Tick-tock, Dave. Better bust a move.

  
Right.

  
We also do offices
and recreational vehicles.

  
What's that smell?

  
It's your cologne.

  
What did you do?
Dump the entire bottle on the rug?

  
We Call it scenting the area.

  
I gotta admit I'm surprised.

  
The place looks great.

  
Well, Dave, we chipmunks
are notoriously tidy.

  
Yeah, I see that.

  
-Those bread sticks smell great.
-Yeah.

  
So when's dinner?

  
Guys, I don't know
how to tell you this...

  
...but it's just gonna be Claire and me.

  
Hold the phone, Dave.

  
-We can't have--
-No.

  
-Even if we--
-No.

  
-We thought it--
-And no. Look, in the other room.

  
Jeez.

  
What a buzzkill, man.

  
-I never knew you could cook this well.
-It's all about slow roasting.

  
It takes longer.
But when it comes to flavor, why rush?

  
Well, I'm impressed.

  
-I've been seeing your photos.
-Yeah, it's going really great.

  
How about you, how's your job?

  
Great. Loving it.

  
How do you think it's going?

  
Terrible. They're not even sniffing
each other.

  
Alvin. Dave said that--

  
Dave needs a little help
from the love doctor.

  
And his assistant.

  
Get back here.

  
You know, this is nice.

  
Just two friends having dinner.
Hanging out.

  
No pressure. Nothing weird.

  
My stereo does that all the time.
It's like it has a mind of its own.

  
You were saying?

  
Oh, nothing. I was just a little nervous
about coming over here.

  
I wasn't sure if you thought
this was a date or something.

  
A date? No.

  
The wiring in my unit is shot.

  
You should get an electrician
to fix that.

  
I don't need anyone
to fix anything for me.

  
Okay.

  
Could you excuse me for a moment?
I'm gonna go check the fuse box.

  
Hey.

  
Look, I know what you guys
are up to. Alvin.

  
-Breath check.
-Where's al--?

  
Dave, are you okay?

  
Everything's fine.

  
Why did you do that?

  
I was just trying to help, Dave.
You have garlic breath.

  
Well, stop helping.
You're ruining everything.

  
I think I got something in my eye.

  
Here. Let me see.

  
Yeah. It looks really irritated.
It's so red. What happened?

  
What was that?

  
Oh, I thought I saw a rat.

  
-A rat?
-Probably nothing.

  
Here, let's finish eating, huh?

  
Tomorrow, I'm gonna call
the exterminator.

  
-What?
-Claire.

  
Dave? Dave?

  
-Tell her she completes you.
-What are you doing?

  
-You got it, Dave.
-Dave.

  
Dave, let go.

  
I'm sorry, Claire. It's just....

  
I lost my job, Claire.

  
And I guess I just needed a hug.

  
Well, why didn't you just say so?
Tell me what happened.

  
Well, this is gonna sound
really strange.

  
No games. No fooling around.

  
-The truth?
-Please, I'm begging you.

  
My life is being sabotaged
by talking chipmunks.

  
-You know what?
-I'm not crazy, I swear.

  
You haven't changed at all.

  
Wait. Claire. Don't go. I can explain.

  
Chipmunks.

  
You should've kissed her, Dave.

  
She wanted you.

  
Alvin, you're not helping.

  
Don't give up, Dave.

  
Go away. Leave me alone.

  
Dave, would you like a cookie?

  
I said, leave me alone.

  
Is it me, or was he a little mad?

  
I wonder, is Dave mad? Yes.

  
He really did have garlic breath.

  
Yeah, well-played, guys.

  
Idea.

  
Who has cab fare?

  
Cab fare?
We don't even have pockets.

  
Dear fellas, I'm sorry,
but this isn't really working out.

  
I don't know what made me think
I could handle you guys...

  
...when I can barely manage
my own life.

  
You should go back to your real home
in the forest.

  
That's what's best for all of us.

  
I'm sorry it has to be this way, but....

  
Guys?

  
Simon, Theodore?

  
Guys?

  
Alvin?

  
Alvin!

  
Simon?

  
Theodore?

  
Alvin?

  
Alvin.

  
Hello?

  
Hello?

  
Kids.

  
Christmas, Christmastime is near

  
Time for toys and time for cheer

  
We can't hardly stand the wait

  
Please, Christmas, don't be late

  
Welcome to Jett Records.

  
Okay. New rule.
No going out after 9.

  
And not at all unless
I know where you're going.

  
Were you worried about us, Dave?

  
No. I just need to know, that's all.

  
Wait. If you're not worried,
then why do you need to know?

  
I need to know, okay?

  
Alvin.

  
Oh, sorry about that. Yeah.

  
-Sorry.
-Kids, huh?

  
They keep you on your toes.
Do you have any?

  
Three boys.

  
Well, some days
are better than others.

  
And some days
you just wanna close them in a box...

  
...leave the box in the park
and run away, you know?

  
Quick, hide.

  
Guys, what's all this?

  
Toaster waffles.

  
You know, I can't afford
all these toaster waffles.

  
-What?
-Well, in case you didn't notice...

  
...I don't have a job anymo--

  
My song?

  
-All right.
-Yeah.

  
-Hello?
-Hey, Dave.

  
Hey, how's my favorite songwriter?

  
-Ian?
-Tell me you've heard the song.

  
Yeah. I'm listening to it right now.

  
How did you--? When did--?

  
Speed of business, baby.
That's how we do it. That's how I roll.

  
Got a friend in satellite radio,
put it in immediate rotation.

  
And that video of your little guys,
10 million hits already on YouTube.

  
It's crazy. I gotta go.

  
Hey, put some clothes on those guys.
It's kind of embarrassing.

  
We owed you, Dave.

  
So we're good
with the toaster waffles, right? Dave?

  
Soup's on.

  
Alvin.

  
So, what do you think?

  
Cool.

  
All right.

  
Toothbrush, huh? Okay.

  
No.

  
Dave...

  
...are you awake?

  
I am now.

  
I had a nightmare.

  
Can I sleep with you?

  
You won't even know I'm here.

  
Okay. Sure.
But stay on that side of the bed.

  
Oh, okay.

  
Theodore, that's not your side
of the bed.

  
-Theodore, wake up. It's Christmas.
-Come on, man. It's Christmas.

  
Boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

  
On the first day of Christmas
Dave woke up

  
Come on, man, it's Christmas.
Hallelujah.

  
Wake up, lazy bones.

  
Oh, yeah. Christmas.

  
-Up and at them.
-You can sleep when you're dead.

  
-I'm coming
-Come on, Dave.

  
Hurry up, Dad.

  
-Dad?
-Dave. I said Dave.

  
This is shaping up to be
my favorite Christmas ever.

  
-You want to open mine first.
-Open mine first.

  
-No, Dave, mine is better.
-You guys got me presents?

  
Of course.

  
All right. Simon?

  
Wow, it's a--

  
It's a paper-clip compass.

  
A paper-clip compass.
Now I'll never get lost.

  
Me next.

  
Alvin.

  
-My wallet.
-Do you like it?

  
really? I wanted to get you something
you'd use every day.

  
And I have been using this
for almost 10 years now.

  
Very thoughtful, Alvin. Thank you.

  
Yeah, the look on your face
says it all, Dave.

  
Oh, nicely done, Theodore.
''To Dav.''

  
Let's see, it says, ''Merry Christmas.
Love, Theodore.''

  
And it's got a nice picture
of some pineapples?

  
Those aren't pineapples.
That's our family.

  
Look, fellas. Let's make sure
we understand each other here.

  
I'm not your....

  
You know,
your dad or anything, right?

  
But you're like a dad.

  
Well, not really.

  
I mean, we're friends for sure.

  
And I write your music, you know,
manage your career.

  
-Make us sweaters.
-Feed us.

  
Let us sleep in your bed
when we have nightmares.

  
That's what friends do.

  
So who wants to open their presents?

  
-Is that a trick question? We do.
-Yeah.

  
-Presents.
-Oh, boy.

  
Presents. Presents. Presents.

  
I can't wait to open mine first.

  
Envelopes.

  
They're savings bonds.

  
Cool.

  
You know, in seven years, you're
gonna get to buy something really nice.

  
Do you maybe have any
that you bought seven years ago?

  
-Alvin, manners.
-Thank you, Dave.

  
Yeah. Thanks, Dave.

  
-Ian?
-Who wants presents?

  
-All right.
-Cool.

  
Hey, there's plenty more
where this came from.

  
Bring them on in, fellas.

  
-Oh, yeah.
-Jackpot.

  
What are you doing?

  
-Taking care of my boys.
-Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

  
Weird. What happened
to your presents?

  
-Which one is mine?
-That big one is for me, I think.

  
What did you get them?

  
Savings bonds.

  
Great. Just what every kid dreams of.

  
You're in luck.
Your uncle Ian came through.

  
-Cool.
-uncle Ian?

  
Is-- Is this for me?

  
No, it's for Simon.

  
-Theodore.
-Oh, boy.

  
-And Alvin.
-Thank you, Santa.

  
This is for you.
You like the Oak Ridge Boys, right?

  
Yeah, you're welcome.

  
And guess what, guys.

  
uncle Ian is gonna have
a big launch party for the new CD.

  
That's right. Press, paparazzi.
Hollywood hotshots.

  
The whole nine yards.

  
-Awesome.
-Sweet.

  
Yeah. Dave, you've got one week
to write me a new hit single.

  
All right? Something funky and fresh.

  
-Peace. We out.
-Bye, uncle Ian.

  
-Merry Christmas.
-Now it really is Christmas.

  
Mayday, mayday.

  
This way, this way, this way.

  
All right. All right. Settle in, settle in.
Thank you for coming.

  
It is a very special night tonight.

  
Here at Jett Records, we pride ourselves
on bringing you tomorrow's music today.

  
Oh, and guess what. I did it again.

  
Ladies and gentlemen,
here to sing their new hit single...

  
...give it up
for Alvin, Simon and Theodore.

  
Yeah, in the place to be

  
Chipmunks on the M-I-C
"Witch Doctor"

  


  
Everybody, can they do it?

  
Can they do it?

  
Come on, people, let's get to it

  
Let's get to it

  
Come on, shake, come on, roll
Everybody hit the floor

  
Come on, shake, come on, roll
With the Chipmunks, here we go

  
I told the witch doctor
I was in love with you

  
I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me too

  
And then the witch doctor
He told me what to do

  
He said:
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah

  
To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang

  
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang

  
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah

  
To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang

  
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang

  
Yo, DJ, pump this party!

  
Everybody, can they do it?

  
-Can they do it?
-Go! Go! Go!

  
Come on, people, let's get to it

  
Go! Go! Go!

  
Come on, shake, come on, roll
Everybody hit the floor

  
Come on, shake, come on, roll
With the Chipmunks, here we go

  
Alvin! Simon! Theodore!

  
I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me true

  
I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me nice

  
And then the witch doctor
He gave me this advice

  
He said to me:

  
To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang

  
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang

  
You've been keeping love from me

  
-And that's not very smart
-Not very smart

  
I went out and found myself someone
Who'd tell me how to win your heart

  
My friend the witch doctor
He told me what to say

  
My friend the witch doctor
He told me what to do

  
I know that you'll be mine
When I say this to you

  
-Oh, baby, baby!
-Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah

  
To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang

  
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang

  
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah

  
To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang

  
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang

  
Yeah.

  
All right, party people.
You know how we do it.

  
Get on that dance floor,
let me see what you got.

  
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

  
-You mind if I grab a few pics?
-Claire.

  
-Not at all. Fire away.
-Great.

  
I've got a new assignment.
I'm covering your rise to fame.

  
-Oh, this is Alvin, Simon and Theodore.
-Hi.

  
-Hello.
-Hi, Claire.

  
You're hot.

  
Forgot you guys haven't officially met.

  
So, Dave...

  
...I'm sorry about that night.
I really thought that you--

  
That I was insane?

  
I totally understand it.

  
Talking chipmunks.
It's a lot to take in over dinner.

  
But look at you now. You've got
the career, promising future, kids.

  
You're like a family.

  
Don't say ''family'' in front of Dave.
It gives him gas.

  
-Like, clear-the-room gas.
-Does not.

  
He doesn't want a family.

  
Why don't you guys go and play
or raid the dessert table?

  
Don't take it personally, you guys.

  
Some people don't know a good thing
when they've got it.

  
Right, Dave?

  
Claire.

  
No offense, big guy,
but you are not good at this.

  
Hey, what do you think of this?

  
-What is it?
-It's Alvin.

  
That looks nothing like Alvin.

  
Well, yeah. It's a prototype.
We'll sell a million of these things.

  
It's voice-activated.
Here, say something to it.

  
Hello, ugly little Alvin doll
that looks nothing like Alvin.

  
-See? You love it. It's Spanish.
-You know what? That's just weird.

  
Come on, Dave, Dave, Dave.

  
We've got to expand
the Munks' fan base.

  
I mean, forget about the music.

  
The music is but a means
to the big money, okay?

  
I'm talking about our own
fur clothing line, cologne.

  
-I mean--
-They're just kids.

  
No, they're rats.

  
And they could make us both
so much money...

  
-...if you just let me work with them.
-I can't hear you, the music's too loud.

  
Don't go against me on this, Dave.
I never lose.

  
Has anyone tried
the chocolate meatballs?

  
I'll probably go into insulin shock.
But it's worth it.

  
Oh, a sweet, sweet,
sweet molasses meat.

  
Hey, alvster. Love the song, bro.

  
-Up top.
-What's up, player?

  
So I see you're enjoying my little spread
that I've put out for you guys.

  
What am I talking about?
You probably eat like this all the time.

  
Well, Dave says
he doesn't wanna spoil us.

  
Dude, you're a rock star.
You're supposed to be spoiled.

  
I mean, you should be riding
in limousines and private planes.

  
And you should be going to parties
like this every night.

  
really?
Because Dave says we need our sleep.

  
Look, Alvin, this is hard to say
but, I mean, I gotta be upfront about it.

  
Dave's holding you back, you know.
I could be making you 20 large a day.

  
-Is that a lot?
-Yes.

  
Another thing-- I'm not gonna tell you.
I will tell you.

  
Look, behind your back,
Dave Calls you...

  
...''the rats.''

  
-Rats?
-Yeah. Whatever, right? I know.

  
Well, don't let it bother you.
I mean, me? I consider you boys family.

  
And if there's anything you need,
anything at all...

  
...give your uncle Ian a call, all right?

  
-Oh, right.
-Ciao.

  
Come on, pal.
You drive like my grandmother.

  
Get a wheelchair. Move over!

  
Hey, guys, look at me.
Up, up and away.

  
Alvin.

  
Can't help you, Simon.
I'm about to take the lead here.

  
Hey, guys,
I have an idea for a new song.

  
Hey, Dave.

  
What's going on in here?
I thought I told you guys to clean up.

  
We are.

  
-Who's that?
-uncle Ian hired us a housekeeper.

  
She's also a masseuse.

  
Come on, move over, road hog.

  
Drive it or park it, pal.
Get in the slow lane.

  
-Where did you get that game?
-uncle Ian.

  
Move it or lose it!
Get some training wheels, buddy.

  
Okay, you know what?

  
That's enough.

  
What are you doing?
I was about to beat my high score.

  
Too bad. Where's Theodore?

  
Spit it out.

  
-Spit it out.
-No.

  
Jett Records.

  
Okay. That's it. Meeting. Now.
Everyone on the couch.

  
Could you give us a minute?

  
Guys, look, it's hard, I know.

  
Three months ago, you were hanging out
in a tree somewhere and now you're--

  
Major rock stars.

  
Okay. Whatever.
My point is just because you're--

  
Major rock stars.

  
Doesn't mean you can have or do
whatever you want.

  
Well, uncle Ian says
we should always be happy.

  
Okay, you know what?

  
He's not your uncle.

  
He also, David, said
that we should be making $20 a day.

  
Guess what.
You're making way more than that.

  
And because I care,
I'm putting it all away for you.

  
Just like storing nuts for the winter.

  
Oh, winter's for losers.

  
Yeah. shouldn't we have a say
in how to build our investment portfolio?

  
Where is all this coming from?
You guys are just kids.

  
-Kids, Dave, or rats?
-What?

  
Well, uncle Ian says
we're like his family.

  
Oh, yeah?
Well, if you love uncle Ian so much...

  
...and don't think I'm watching out
for you...

  
...why don't you go live
with Uncle Ian?

  
Dave?

  
Are you still mad at us?

  
Dave?

  
''Dear fellas, I'm sorry, but....

  
You should go back
to your real home in the forest.''

  
I guess he really does want us to go.

  
I told you, Dave.

  
I never lose.

  
Boys, welcome to your new home.

  
-Oh, yeah. Daddy's home.
-Yeah.

  
Can we play with all this stuff?

  
Sure, why not? It's your house.

  
So, what are the rules around here?

  
Oh, I do have one rule...

  
-...that there are no rules!
-Cool.

  
Four degrees elevation.

  
Six degrees azimuth.

  
Fire!

  
Prepare to face the fury
of my vengeance.

  
Don't make me laugh.

  
Pray for a quick demise,
young chipmunk.

  
Uppercut. Left. Fake-out, fake-out.

  
Your kung fu is no match
for my rockets.

  
Sneak attack.

  
Okay, Simon. That's enough.

  
I'm finished now. Simon.

  
-Hey, give me that.
-Let go, Alvin.

  
Oh, come on.

  
-You had a turn.
-Who says you get a turn?

  
Give me that.

  
Simon!

  
-You got to try.
-Get your mangy paws off of it.

  
-Scram.
-I want it.

  
Alvin, you don't decide.

  
-Why didn't the airbags deploy?
-Theodore, don't go into the light.

  
-Let's do it again.
-Awesome.

  
-playing hard?
-Oh, yes.

  
Good.

  
Because tomorrow, you start working hard.
Coast to coast in five days.

  
Well, Dave says that touring is no live
for a kid.

  
For a normal kid.
You guys are superstars.

  
-Yes.
-Which reminds me...

  
...Simon, let's get rid of these
boring glasses.

  
And try on these super cool
in-the-now glasses.

  
Oh, my God, oh.

  
These would be great
if I could see out of them.

  
Your eyes will adjust.
Come on, boys. Let's hit the road.

  
-Shotgun.
-Hit the road.

  
Alvin--

  
Give me a big fella. Alvin, big, big.

  
No hiding. Come on, come on.
Make love to the camera.

  
Sell it. Big smile. Yes.
Theodore, chin out. Yeah. That's it.

  
Good stuff. There you go.
Come on, get in there.

  
Strong. Give me some booty.

  
Spank it. There you got it.
Now you got it.

  
If the Chipmunks like Crunchy Nibbles,
your pet will love them.

  
Cut.

  
Here we are.

  
Okay? All right?

  
Hold it.

  
We're not done.

  
-You tell me.
-Killing me.

  
-What do you want?
-You are killing me here.

  
There's no button I can push
that wakes them to sing notes.

  
You kidding?
There's 5000 buttons here.

  
-What button do you want me to push?
-Fine. I've got it.

  
All right, guys. Guess what your
uncle Ian brought you. Coffee.

  
I love toffee.

  
No, it's coffee, Theodore, coffee. It's a--
Like a super cool energy health drink...

  
...with whipped cream and caramel
and two pumps of chocolate.

  
Enjoy.

  
That ought to keep them awake.

  
-Get munk'd
-Go, go, go

  
Yeah, Chipmunks
Always can get munk'd

  
Hey, hey, hey

  
Come and get munk'd
With the Chipmunk rugrats

  
Come and get munk'd with the Munks
Get munk'd with the Chipmunk rugrats

  
Come and get munk'd with the Munks

  
Stop, stop. Come on, guys.
We need more energy, okay?

  
We need more dry ice. We need more,
you know, wow. All right?

  
We're the Chipmunks,
for crying out loud.

  
This is absurd.
I feel like P. Diddy with fur.

  
And to be honest, the new songs
don't really sound like us.

  
Well, you know what I think? I think
the new direction is perfect, you know.

  
It's all about today's edge.

  
Dave always said
it was all about the music.

  
''Dave always said....''

  
You know what? Dave, Dave, Dave.
Dave is not here, okay? It's me.

  
It's fun uncle Ian, all right? Okay?

  
What are you--? What are you
gonna say? What's your name?

  
-Taffy.
-Taffy? What kind of name is Taffy?

  
What do you do?

  
-Choreography.
-I don't know what ''choreography'' is.

  
-What is that?
-It's dance.

  
Oh, is it dancing? Well, next time say,
you know, ''I'm the dance guy--'' Hello?

  
Who? Dave Seville.

  
Name rings a bell. A dead...

  
...broken bell.

  
-Just let me talk to the guys.
-I don't think that's such a good idea.

  
The boys are still stinging a little bit
from you kicking them out.

  
-That's not what happened.
-Denial.

  
So, what's this I hear
about a European tour?

  
You're taking them away
for six months?

  
No, 12 actually.
If we can get China to go chipmunk.

  
Twelve?

  
Look, I just wanted to say hi.
See how they're doing.

  
They're doing great.
They're loving life.

  
Living large.

  
Face it, Dave. They've moved on.

  
-They're happy now.
-Look, Ian, I wanna talk to them.

  
Put them on the phone.

  
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna happen, Dave.

  
Got a world tour,
gonna start tomorrow.

  
And these guys don't need
the extra pressure.

  
-We'll send you a postcard.
-Ian, you can't do this.

  
They're not ready for something
like that. They're just kids.

  
-I'm gonna see them.
-Look, Dave, I'm-- Wait.

  
-Ian?
-Yeah? What?

  
-Ian.
-I can't--

  
Ian...

  
...was that Dave?

  
Yes. Yes, it was.

  
He wanted me to let you know
he's great and he's happy.

  
He's really, really happy. So.... All right.

  
And is he coming to the show?

  
You know what? I sent him tickets.
And here's the thing, he sent them back.

  
Yeah, I know. I guess he's busy,
you know. Got better things to do.

  
Hey, come on.
What's with the long furry faces?

  
We're gonna have fun.
We're gonna have a big show.

  
I'll tell you what, you guys like
deep-tissue massage? All right?

  
I know a guy. Let me Call my guy.
I'll get on that.

  
Hey, captain, come here.

  
Listen.

  
Dave Seville.
Learn the name, look for the face.

  
If he shows up tomorrow night,
he doesn't get near my chipmunks.

  
-Got it? Okay.
-Got it.

  
uncle Ian?

  
-What are you doing here?
-Can I sleep with you?

  
I had a nightmare.

  
Oh, you had a nightmare?

  
I had a nightmare too.
In my nightmare...

  
...I had to put together 37 dates
in 42 days, in 16 different countries.

  
And I had to coordinate different radio and print interviews...

  
...in five different languages.

  
But you know what, Theo?
The only difference is...

  
...in my nightmare, when I open
my eyes, it doesn't end.

  
So is that a no?

  
Guys...

  
...I wanna go home.

  
What do you mean? You are home.

  
No, I mean, ''home'' home.

  
You know, with Dave.

  
But, Theodore, come on.
Wake up and smell the toffee.

  
Dave doesn't even want us. He doesn't
care enough to even come to our show.

  
Here's Julianne Reynolds
with today's entertainment news.

  
Too tired to rock?
The Chipmunks might be.

  
Rumor of exhaustion and voice strain are
swirling around the singing sensation.

  
Is it because of toaster waffle overload?
Or a rigorous tour schedule?

  
It's hard to say. But manager-producer
Ian Hawke has assured Fox...

  
...the trio will make
their first stop tonight...

  
...on their highly anticipated world tour
at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles.

  
That's it.

  
Okay.

  
You three sound like
you've been gargling nails.

  
-I'll cover for you.
-Thank you.

  
Can we get wardrobe
down here, please?

  
Well?

  
I could give you a lot of fancy terms,
but, bottom line, they're exhausted.

  
Okay, well, give them a shot
or a cream or a pill or something.

  
I've invested every dime I have
in these guys.

  
They need a long rest.

  
A long rest. Are you--? Okay.
Yeah, a long rest, right.

  
Right, yeah. I'm not a doctor, so....

  
I'll get them that rest. Thank you.
I'll take care of it.

  
Thank you so much. I will--
I appreciate it. Hey, hey, doc.

  
Chipmunk fever, catch it.

  
Knock, knock.

  
So listen, guys,
I just talked to the doctor.

  
And I don't feel right about
sending you guys out like this.

  
So you're gonna cancel the show?

  
No. No,
then I'd have to give out refunds.

  
No. What I'm talking about
is having you guys lip-synch. Yeah.

  
Isn't that like cheating?

  
No, it's not like cheating. It's--
Cheating is wrong.

  
This is more like helping.
Yeah, all the superstars do it.

  
Just make sure that you mouth the
words exactly like we recorded them.

  
-Otherwise, people will know.
-That we're cheating.

  
-No.
-Guys, what other choice do we have?

  
Yeah. See?
That's why he's the one with the letter.

  
All right, guys, tighten up.

  
And remember, mouth the words
and no one will know.

  
Love you.

  
You know you got it made

  
When you drop your Escalade
For the drop top

  
Iced out, rocks hot
Droppin' dollars, ladies holler

  
Hey, gotta get that cream

  
You know you got it made
When they send in a parade

  
When you drop down
Write a check in town

  
All just for one day

  
Gotta get that cream

  
-Don't you know that's how they roll?
-Roll, roll, roll

  
Can you get down with the
Funk, funk, funk of the Chipmunks?

  
Baby, you know

  
Funk, funk, funk of the Chipmunks

  
Oh, come on,
you gotta have one more ticket.

  
Sorry.

  
Come on, here's Theodore

  
You're here to stay
When you're always getting paid

  
And it don't stop, never, no
It won't stop no matter what they say

  
-Gotta live the dream
-Take it, Simon

  
You're here to stay
When your honeys think you hit

  
'Cause we gots it
Everybody watch it

  
I love it. You love it? Chipmunk fever.
Catch it, baby.

  
Dave Seville.

  
No, there's no Dave Seville
on this list.

  
You know what? That's fine.
I'm the editor of the L.A. Music Journal.

  
-No, I don't think so.
-He's with me.

  
He's my assistant.

  
Okay.

  
Thanks, Claire.

  
What's going on, Dave?
What are you--?

  
I gotta get my boys back
but Ian's trying to keep me out.

  
Your boys.

  
I know that probably sounds weird
coming from me.

  
It's a good weird, though.

  
Because after all I did to mess up
everything, including you--

  
-Dave, your boys. We should go.
-Right. Okay.

  
How we roll

  
Come on, can you feel it?

  
-How we roll
-Yeah, yeah, come on

  
If you're gonna do something,
do it fast. Here.

  
-You're press, remember?
-Thanks.

  
Roll

  
-Let's go, pal.
-I'm a photographer.

  
-I have a press pass.
-You're out of here.

  
Alvin! Alvin!

  
Alvin!

  
-Dave! He's here.
-It's Dave.

  
What's going on?

  
Alvin, what are you doing?

  
I'm sending a message
to our dear old uncle Ian.

  
-Sounds like a plan to me.
-Me too.

  
Come on, guys.

  
Hey, Ian...

  
...kiss my furry cheeks.

Just let them go.

  
But the guy just left. You should have
said something about five seconds ago.

  
Come back.

  
Ian, they need a real life.
Not all of this.

  
Besides, they just ruined the concert.

  
Word will get out,
no one will come to see them.

  
Dave, they're chipmunks who talk.
people will come.

  
Guys, with me.

  
Roll, that's how we roll

  
You'll never take us alive.

  
They just did take us alive, Alvin.

  
It's a figure of speech, Simon.

  
Instead of criticizing me, why not use
your big brain to think of a way out?

  
Go, go, go. Go.

  
Come on.

  
Step on it, Dave. You're losing him.

  
How did you guys...?

  
We are talking chipmunks, Dave.

  
We can get out of a cat carrier.
Not even hard to do.

  
You came back for us.

  
Well, of course I came back.
We're a family.

  
Holy nuts.

  
-What?
-Am I going crazy?

  
Or did he just say ''family''?

  
I know...

  
...but I really missed you guys.

  
I missed you too, Dave.

  
Me too.

  
-So did Alvin. He's too Cool to admit it.
-Yeah, too macho.

  
Missed you too.

  
Sorry, I had some sentimentality
stuck in my throat.

  
I just said, I missed you too.

  
Whatever.
Who are you guys to judge me?

  
Okay, you know what?
I miss my friend Dave, okay?

  
I'll scream it from the rooftops.
And I'm not afraid. I'm not ashamed.

  
That's right. I love you, Dave.

  
Come here.

  
-Dave?
-Yes, Alvin?

  
Now can I steer?
Oh, please, please, please.

  
-I want to work the windshield wipers.
-Oh, and I'd like to beep the horn.

  
Have at it, fellas.

  
-I'm a good beeper.
-Save some horn for the rest of us.

  
-Come on, Dave, drive faster.
-Not with you steering.

  
Dave, you drive like a sleepy old bear.

  
-Okay, Alvin, that's enough.
-Enough of what? Of being awesome?

  
Alvin, I said that's enough.

  
Hey, look, Dave, no paws.

  
Hey, if you guys behave, maybe
I'll let you call me ''uncle Ian'' again.

  
Deal?

  
No!

  
Claire.

  
-Hey.
-Come on in.

  
-Hi, Claire.
-Well, hello, Clarina.

  
-Hi, guys.
-Hope you like toaster waffies.

  
And, for us classy chipmunks,
a bit of the bubbly.

  
Stupid cork. Doesn't--

  
I'm not gonna say it.

  
Good grief.

  
Are you still not gonna say it?

  
Nope.

  
I'm gonna say it. Alvin!

  
Okay!

  


  
Okay, guys, come on,
let's try it again.

  
Here we go, and sing.

  
Come on, sing for your uncle Ian.
Come on, sing.

He's like the coolest man on the world. Thank you. 
Come forth. 
Welcome my friends. 
I just wanted to say that "Planet Page 2/51

Vortulagy" is a huge influence on me and ... ... and my work and Sebastian 
Rico is a wonderful protagonist. 
Don't tell me. 
You're a writer. 
I am, yeah. 
He actually won a Nebulon 
Award in 1992. 
Working on a follow up. 
I'd love to see that. 
No, not today. 
No, it's a legal thing, 
I'm sure it's ... 
I'm sure it's good, it's 
a wonderful cover ...

... take Area 51, and the 
Black Mailbox in Nevada ... 
... and down to Camp Verde, 
then to Apache Junction and ... ... then down to Rosewell, New Mexico, for the sight of the famous crash in '47. - Ah, no ... 
- Everybody knows that. 
- Stop it ! 
It's an alleged sight at this point. But why would they admit the crash if the crach happened somewhere else? - Just agree to ... 
- Agree to disagree. 
Page 4/51
- Again. 
- That's what we ... 
Do you believe in Aliens? 
What do you mean, "Aliens"?

Pangenesis". 
I didn't read that one. 
"The Jenny Star Pepper 
in the Great Brass Hand"? 
Nah ... 
"The Robots Mistress"? 
Nah, I like romances. 
That's kind of a romance. 
What you mean? 
A woman and a machine? 
- Ah ... yeah.

Be rude to me. 
Uhh ... Eggy. 
An alien just sitting on my palms. Clive, um ...

It's brilliant !

Hey, fellas ! 
How you doin' today? 
What is this, some kind 
of gay bar? 
Nah, it's a place where you 
can get a bite to eat and ... 
... maybe share a close encounter. Yep, sounds like a gay bar. 
Oh ! Oh, no we're just friends. So, you guys look like you 
could do like a couple of beers. You go do that ! 
All right, we can do that ! 
Yeah, yes. 
Leave it, leave it.

Should I go and have a look? 
No ... 
Extraterrestail Highway 
Black Mailbox 
Wow ... 
It's probably the coolest thing 
I've ever seen. 
Do you remember when we 
googled it on your mom's computer and ... ... and the phone rang and you 
thought that it was the FBI ? 
I didn't really thinks it was the FBI. - You started crying. 
- I just ... 
You never been to Brussels. 
Go stand next to it. 
Yep. 
Smile. 
It's good. 
Imagine if we got buzzed by a craft. Amazing, isn't it? 
Smile. 
What would you do if they actually landed? Well, the first contact is a big 
responsibility, isn't it? 
They come in peace, 
we go to pieces? 
- That's not how i roll. 
- Nah ... 
Do you think, that's those men? 
No ... 
Page 7/51

I think we've seen enough ... 
Let's go ... 
Go, go, go ... !

A rapist who break arms? 
I don't want my arms broken ! 
Come on, the toilet ...

-You know I've god child's bladder. Do not let 'em get past ! 
What you want me to do? 
Ram them? 
What about the deposit ?! 
It's not them ! 
It's not them, 
It's not them ... 
Ah, oh my God ... 
It was awful ... 
Hello? 
Maybe you should call for help. It's ringing. 
I wouldn't do that if i were you. Put ... the phone ... down. 
Oh, fuck me ... 
What have you done to him ?! 
I didn't do anything, he fainted. But ... you made him faint ! 
Yes, but it's not like i set 
my phaser to faint ... 
You've got a phaser? 
No ... I don't ... look ! 
Listen ... 
Hey ... I really need your help. Ok? Can we get this guy back in your wagon? What ... whe ... 
You're an alien ! 
To you, I am, yes. 
Are you gonna probe us? 
Why does everyone 
always assume that? 
What am I doing? 
Am I harvesting farts? 
How much can I learn from an ass? Page 8/51

What ... I ... what ... 
I'm sorry, what's your name? 
Graeme Willy 
And what's his name? 
Uh, that's the writer 
Clive Gollings. 
Ok, cool. 
I'm Paul. 
Paul? 
Yeah. 
It's a nickname, it stuck. 
My ship crashed and i ... 
... dog ! It doesn't matter. 
Look, can we get Clive Gollings back on the RV and get the hell outa here, please? - I can't be ... 
- I'm in a hell of a pickle ... 
And if you don't help me, 
I could die on this road tonight. 
I don't know, we're in a 
quite tight schedule ... 
Look man ... 
Sometimes you just gotta 
roll the dice. 
What do you say? 
Okay. 
Okay. Perfect, great ! 
Okay, help me, help me grab him. 
This man's peed his pants. 
Yeah, he's got childs bladder. 
Oh, fantastic ... 
Doesn't this thing go any faster? 
Well, I ... 
- I'm sorry, the speed limit is 70 ... - Screw the speed limit ! 
Actually, no. Uh, don't screw it. 
That's good thinking. Okay? 
Stay conspicuous. 
That's good. 
How come i can understand you? 
You using some sort of neoron language router? Actually, I'm speaking English, 
you fucking idiot ! 
Sorry ... 
Page 9/51
You're in shock right now. 
I understand this must be very weird for you. Just act normal and drive north. 
Okay? 
Gotta get as much as we can 
between us and the Big Guy. 
Zoil? 
What's happening? 
He's gone. 
Shit ! 
Looks like he hitched a ride too. 
- What do you mean? 
- Tire tracks. 
Bastard jacked a native ?! 
Could be too ... 
Don't you think this is a bit 
of a coincidence? 
Are you suggesting anew? 
The little fucker might've 
found home. 
There might be a rescue party on the way. Zoil, we need to break out the big guns. Do you think that's wise? 
The last thing we need is... 
... a hu-ha ?! 
Maybe you're right. 
Listen, I got 2 rookies on a 
special mission 75 clicks north of you. I'll have them set up a road block. These are just civillians, 
why don't you let me take care of it? You might need the extra muscle. 
Just keep 'em in the dark. 
I don't want any loose ends. 
Well, these roads can be 
treacherous at night. 
People get in accidents ... 
... all the time. 
I like your thinking. 
Get it done. 
Heads up ! 
We just got reassigned. 
Nice ! 
What about the sandwich? 
Page 10/51
- She said we could share it. 
- I love this job. 
I love pistachios. 
I hate when you get a closed one, right? I usually just bite them. 
No, you don't do it at all. 
They should be opened on their own way. - No, that's mussels. 
- No, I meant the pistachios ... 
What are you doing ?! 
He's ok, he's fine, he's friendly !! His name's Paul ! 
Aliens aren't called Paul ... 
Was that Klingon? 
You psychotic nerd ! 
Listen, Paul is from a small M-Class planet nothern spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy. Thank you. 
He looks too obvious ! 
There's a reason for that Clive ! Over the last 60 years, the human race has been drip fed of images ... ... of my face, on lunch boxes, 
and t-shirts and shit. 
In case our species do meet, 
you don't have a fuckin' spaz attack !!... Don't do it again ! 
You fuckin' dorf, get 
your fingers outta there ! 
If i get a jorf infection, you're dead ! Oh, my god ! 
Oh, shit ... 
Paul ... 
Paul? 
Ok, ok, this could be it. 
So, what are we looking for again? I don't know. 
What brings you to USA? 
Uh, we're on holiday. 
We've been to comic-con. 
Comic-con? 
Don't tell O'Rilley. 
He loves that shit. 
You guys know Benny Hill? 
Page 11/51
No ... 
Oh my god, look at this ! 
- What ?! 
- Look at this ! 
These guys met Adam Shadowchild. Who the hell's 
Adam Shadowchild? 
He wrote the "Jupiter Praxis". What? 
"Jenny Starpepper 
and the Huge White Gibbon"? 
Huh? 
"Night of the Moths"? 
Are you speaking English? 
He's ... brilliant ... 
What was he like? 
He was a bit intense. 
Oh, he's an artist. 
Let me see this. 
What is this, nerd porn? 
- Oh no, that's Clives ... 
- It's my novel. 
Okay ... 
Uh ! Three tits ! 
That's awesome ... 
You guys should've 
given her 4 tits. 
That's just sick ! 
I was just sayin' 
Do you think this is it? 
Not that full ... 
What else did you find in there? No, not much ... 
Just some pissy jeans. 
- Oh, Clive's got a child bladd.... - Shut up ... 
Okay, you guys can go. 
- Thank you. 
- Thank you. 
Can I have my novel? 
Thank you very much. 
May I ask what you're searching for? No ... 
Come on, Graeme. 
Page 12/51
- Way to go, Dirty Harry. 
- You got that? 
I ... did I catch you? 
Oh my God, like a cold mechanic. I think it's pretty obvious 
what happened there isn't it? 
Is it? 
The government used some kind of neoro toxic paint on the Black Mailbox. Caused a shared hallucination 
about aliens, it makes complete sense. Oh !... 
You're dick is gone ... 
Oh, no ... 
What? 
Come on, grow up ... 
You guys seen my shorts? 
How did you do that? 
How did you go invisible? 
Oh, it's camouflage response. 
Well, like "Predator"? 
Exactly, altough i can only do it while holding my breath. 
You can do it anytime you want? "Anytime". 
That's just like it ... 
Am I the only sane person here ?! Eh ?! 
It's allright for you, isn't it ?! You'll go back to area 51 ... 
... we'll be arrested for 
harboring a fugutive ! 
And sent to Guantanamo Bay ! 
Why don't I go make 
some bagels and coffee? 
Leave you two alone. 
What's the matter Clive? 
There's an alien in the kitchen making bagels and coffee. 
- Did you want tea? 
- No, I don't want tea ! 
Right, because tea is 
weird in America, right? 
They leave the baguette ... 
Page 13/51
What's weird Graeme is that we picked up an extra terrestrial ... ... hitch hiker and you seem 
completely fine with it ! 
Bagels and coffee ... 
Uh ! Marmite ... 
He said his life's in danger. 
He needs our help, you know? 
Sometimes you just gotta 
roll the dice. 
What if we wake up and 
find him inserting a probe ... ... into our anus? 
Apparently they don't do that. Anyone, want one of these? 
Eh, anyone? 
Anyone? 
Eh? 
Coming, ready or not, 
you son of a bitch ... 
Where's the other one? 
I don't know sir. 
Uh ... 
Haggard ! 
Sorry, we were just ... 
Haggard ! 
Fuck ... 
Nice ... uh ... 
Get over here ... it's 
the guy with the badge. 
We were just playing hide and seek ... ... so we have a lot of time. 
Hurry up. 
I was hiding. 
You have any traffic through here? No, just a couple of hillbilly types. Two nerdes in an RV. 
Nerds, huh? 
Yes, they've come from comic-con ! They've met Adam Shadowchild ! Who the hell is 
Adam Shadowchild? 
He ... he wrote Prison Hawk 441. Ok? Jenny Starpepper and 
Page 14/51
the Spinning Worm. 
Right? Fluxing your anus. 
You know you're grown man, right? Probably shave, pay taxes? 
Have pubic hair? 
All of those things. 
- Did you search that vehicle? - Yes , sir. 
What'd you find? 
Uh, nothin' much, just ... 
A book with a green woman with three... - ... titties. 
- Dude, it's three titties. 
Three tits, that's awesome. 
Oh, and some pissy jeans. 
Close that. 
Preexisting problem ... 
Listen to me you freakin' fuck, i want to know everyting you ... ... can remember about the 
pissy nerds, ok? 
We're leaving. 
What about the road block, sir? It didn't work. 
Hey ! Rieces pieces ! 
Yes, thank you. 
Heard there was a commotion 
on the road after Rachel. 
Funny, I didn't hear that. 
It must've been the boys out to paste. Hey. 
That's a bit much, isn't it? 
- What? 
- Put it all back ! 
What about Paul's "Rieces Pieces"? Just hurry up !... 
No, you go ahead. 
Thank you. 
- Is that beast outside yours? - What? 
What do you mean "beast"? 
Your RV? 
Oh, the, yes ... 
The RV is .... 
Page 15/51
Where are you boys from? 
England. 
England. 
I heard about England. 
No guns. 
- No, not many. 
- No ... 
Not really, just you know ... 
Farmers ... 
How are police supposed to shoot anybody? - They don't ... 
- They try not to. 
Um, 20. Keep the change. 
And give it to charity or something. You're amazing, Graeme ! 
That cop didn't suspect a thing ! And Clive ... 
You didn't pee you pants. 
I don't like to be stick in the mud but ... You're asking a lot from us, right? We just met, we don't know 
where we're going, or why ... 
You don't think we deserve an explanation? Look ... the less you guys know the better. I want you to have plausible deniability. Let's just say, I spent a lot of time in that base thinking i was a guest ... Turns out ... I was a prisoner. 
But don't worry. 
I got it all under ... Ah !! 
Fuck, that made me jump. 
Poor little thing. 
I don't know, you could've done mate. Ew ... What are you doin'? 
Just watch ... 
It's a miracle ! 
Man, I'm gonna miss these ... 
What would you do that? 
I'm not gonna eat a dead bird, am I? You got me thinking that I'm 
wasting my time ... 
Don't bring me down ... Oh guys ! Eleven o'clock, 
Twelve o'clock ... 
Page 16/51
Come on, it's fun ! 
If you think about it, 
it's time travel ... 
Eleven o'clock, 
twelve o'clock ... 
Yes, all right ! 
Let me see, let me see. 
No, just sit still ... 
You gonna try me like 
one of your French girls, Jack? 
I'm joking. 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, 
just don't make me look fat, ok? 
- First gravity sats ass ... 
- Paul ! 
Can I ask you a question? 
Shoot ! 
Have you ever done that to a person? 
Yes, I've eaten many people. 
I'm joking big guy ! Relax ... 
No, I mean you know, fix them. 
Oh, no ! Not a dead person. 
Recently dead bird, that's one thing ... ... dead person, whole other ball game. It's actually really dangerous for me, The damage can actually bounce back on to me ... I'm sorry, am I boring you? 
Have you heard this one before? 
Are you tried saussage? 
Don't call me that in front of him ! 
Are you tired though? 
Eggie, I'm bushed ! 
You know what? We're all tired. 
Let's just pull over and stop for the night. We're fugutives Paul, all right? 
I refuse to just ... 
... sit around and wait around to 
get fingered by the Men in Black. 
Look, we just gotta find somewhere quiet, and don't draw attention to ourselves. But, where are we going, Paul? 
Oh, you'll know it when you see it. 
- Two white guys? 
- Two, strange ... 
Page 17/51
Strange white guys, got it. 
- Order anythig weird? 
- Chocolate. 
Chocolate, awkward. 
Zoil, report. 
We've tracked him into a gas 
station in Eli, he maybe travelling ... ... in an RV with two men 
from England. 
New England? 
Old England. 
Creepy. What are they, MI6? 
Negative, just couple of nerds 
in the lam from comic-con. 
Something doesn't feel right. 
I think he's getting help 
from the inside. 
I want those nerds iced and 
that little green prick get back ... ... in his fishbowl or dead, ASAP. 
I'm closing in, I can feel it. 
In 24 hours he'll wish he 
never set foot on planet earth. 
Okay. 
Here we are, this is the place. 
bTHE PEARLY GATES/b 
Yeah, this looks good. 
Doesn't look like anyone's been murdered here. Awfully quiet. 
Quiet is good, Graeme. 
Quiet is our friend. 
Hi there ! 
There's a girl outside ... 
Okay. 
We're just a couple of regular guys on a tour of the American Midwest. 
I don't think she heard you. 
I'm talking to you, 
I'm talking to you. 
Oh, sorry.

Nah, I'm just wondering ... 
Totally cool, if you are. 
Everyone's fine on my planet. 
It's all about the pleasure thing. 
You know I'm sayin'? 
Why you here Paul? 
Oh, I was on a science mission actually. And then I had some 
spaceship related ... problems. 
And I kinda ... crashed ...

- You I wanna have some kind of a 
special power, you know? - Yeah. 
- Something messianic. 
- Okay, Steven. 
- Uh, how about cellular revelification? - Yeah, I don't know what that is. 
Oh, restoration of damaged tissiue 
through telephatic manipulation ... 
- ... of a transit field memory. 
- What's that mean? 
- It means, "healing" Mr Spielberg. 
- Yeah, right. - It's ok. 
Like by touch or something like that like ... ... maybe its finger lights up when 
he reaches out and touches. 
Maybe, you know, somethimes 
I find less is more. 
Hey ... Trust me. 
You'd be surprised how much he's 
Page 20/51
influenced popular culture over the last 60 years. Agent Moulder was right. 
- Agent Moulder was my idea ! 
- Really ?! 
- Wow ... 
- Yeah ! 
That's cool. 
Honk that shit Earth-Man. 
I like this song. 
Harvard's my boy. 
Come on. 
Break it down a bit boys. 
Don't be afraid. 
Yeah, look at me, I'm breaking it down. Use them tongs ! 
Get those tongs ! 
Stope the fire ...

- Hi. 
Good morning. 
May I come in? 
- No. 
- Yeah, Come on in.

So, where's the other one? 
The other one? 
It's just ... 
Page 21/51
Oh, oh, it's ok. 
We don't charge by the person. 
There were three shadows i saw 
dancing around the RV last night, right? - The other one ... 
- Oh ... 
I'm in the can. 
I ate a ... 
... a closed pistachio. 
I'm paying for it. 
It's a nice t-shirt. 
Oh thanks, I got it at my church. 
"EVOLVE THIS" 
- It's Jesus shooting Charles Darwin. 
Why would Jesus wanna 
shoot Charles Darwin? 
Because of his blasphemous theories? 
Are you men of God? 
We're men of science ... 
You know, we believe in the ... 
... establishment of a biological order through the maelstrom of physical ... 
... and chemical chaos. 
The world is 4000 years old and can only be the product of an intelligent design. That's whoreshit !! 
Um ... alright ... 
Well then, please explain how something as complex as the human eye simply just comes into being? Just come into being ?! 
It's the combination of ... 
... billions of years of development 
and cost countless species ! 
What are you talking about ?! 
Evolution baby !! 
Blasphemy ! 
- Blasphemy ?! - Nothing that you can 
say can shake my beliefs. Perfect. 
And the short and certain knowledge that God made Heaven and Earth and ... 
... created us all in his own image. 
- His own image ?! 
- Yeah ... 
Well, I got a question ... 
Page 22/51
How do you explain me ?! 
She's goin'. She's fallin' 
Catch ... 
And that's Jenga. 
Why did you do that ?! 
I ... just ... she fainted ! 
We've gone through this ! 
But we have to take her with us now ! - No ! No ! 
- What ... 
This is America. Kidnapping a Christian, that's worse than harboring a fugutive. Yeah, but she's seen you ! 
If we leave, she's gonna call the police ! No one's gonna believe this 
God bothering cyclop ... 
... let's just dump her on the road ! - Just roll her up on the road ... - No, we can't risk that ! 
If we take us, then we 
can get her on our side. 
Yeah, you'd love her to 
get her on our side, wouldn't you? That doesn't make sense. 
Look, she'll be fine. 
We're quite nice ! 
All right. What about my passport? Oh, God ... Guys.

You've been decieved by an agent 
of Satan himself. 
He's evil ! 
I'm sitting right here, come on ! 
No, no, he's not evil. 
He's just a bit rude. 
We're trying to help him get home. 
He's from another world. 
There's only one world. 
Our world ! 
The world that God, the 
father created ! 
Hey, if it makes feel any better, 
my existence only disproves ... 
... the traditional notions of 
Abraham and todays notion of Chrisian God. 
As well as all thrology, 
that's all i meant. 
Amazing Grace ... 
... How sweet the sound ... 
What is with you people ?! 
Ruth, just listen to me for 
one second, if you could just calm down ... I can't ... drive like this. 
Fuck this ! 
What did you do to her ?! 
I just transfered my collective knowledge and experience through her tactile psyscho connective bridge. Oh, wow, could you do me? 
It really takes the head of me. 
Oh, come on, please. 
Page 24/51

Oh, wow ... 
Oh, yeah ... 
He always knew what was 
going on at Battlestar before me ... 
... 'cause his mom had cable. 
Fine, pull over, I'll do you. 
Absolutely not, no spoilers ! 
I didn't call the Government ! 
I called the police ! 
This is not the police's area 
of expertise Mr Buggs. 
That devil took my doughter. 
What do you mean "devil"? 
And your doughters name 
is Ruth, is it? 
That's right. 
I brought her up by myself 
after her momma died. 
Yeah, she's pretty easy to spot. 
She's got this eye thing since she was 4 years old. Do you have a phone here 
that your doughter might try to ... 
... reach you at if she 
decides to call? 
Yeah, in the back. 
Hey, Peter Parker. 
Wanna put the snappy down and 
get to the phone? 
Right ... 
She'll call me if she can. 
You mentioned it when ... 
Fuck you ... 
Here we go. 
Boys, to the car. 
Sir ... 
Might tell us what we're looking for? 
Yeah, what are we looking for? 
I told you this is a 
need to know operation. 
Yes ... sir. 
But ... 
Sh ... Dammit ... 
Sir, i think it's time you tell us.

I'll sleep on the sofa. 
And then you can have my bed. 
You know? But I'd push the 
tissues off with a pen if i were you ... ... because I've had a cold.

By the way ... 
Severe epiral membrane complicated by mecular deamon in your left ventricilous cavity? How did you know that?

Testament? An eyer for an eye? 
Wait ... i don't ... 
It's okay. You can trust me.

What's new "fat hair" ? 
It's not fat Paul, it's power. 
- Fat power. - It's rude. 
- You're rude. 
Maybe you should call my dad. 
What ?! 
What? Why? 
I've been gona for a whole day, and if he calls the police ... 
... they're gonna be looking for us. If I don't there's a good chance that we all end up in Shit Butt City. You're really getting the hang of this. Thanks dick-milk.

Page 29/51
... and where you are headed Miss Buggs. I ... I ... can't tell you. 
I mean, I ... don't ... know. 
You've been abducted. The individual 
that you're travelling with is highly dangerous. Oh no, he's not dangerous. 
I mean, he's kind of rude ... 
He curses a lot ... 
And a couple of times I've seen 
him scratch his ... 
... space man ... balls. 
Please listen to me. Your father is 
extremely worried about you ... 
... and we'd like to get 
you home Miss Buggs. 
He showed me things. 
She's talking about his 
spaceman balls. 
You know I'm just trying to 
help you, right Ruth? 
I just ... I don't know what's

- We're idiots, remember? 
What should we do now? 
Well, how about hot chocolate and bed? What are you, my grandma? 
Oh, I couldn't sleep. 
I'm too pumped. 
Yeah, me too. Let's get some beers. Find somewhere to chill. 
What do you say? 
What if someone sees you? 
It's dead out there. 
And I can do this ... 
- Ok, I'm in. 
- Roggie? 
Page 31/51

- Bowinkle? 
- Well, I'm a little bit tired. 
- Don't be a pussy ...

Get your hands off me. 
Gus ?! 
Something i can help you, with? 
Yeah, you mind telling me 
what happened here? 
Uh ... just a good ol' fashioned 
beer soke slobber knocker. 
See anything unusual? 
Couple hillbilly types in the back 
of that meat wagon won't stop crying. Did you gentlemen see anything 
unusual this evening? 
Are we sure? 
Thank you. 
bFUCK YOU/b 
- It's a nice window. 
- This is the little cowboy, isn't it? I'll tell you, tell you, that's just funny. It was when you 
kiss me yesterday. 
- Sorry. 
- No. 
I was like, "Girl for you rapists !" Do it again if you like. 
What? 
Said, you can do it 
again if you like. 
Really? 
If you're gonna try it, then maybe 
you should do it with a friend, you know ... ... rather than some stranger, because, there's a lot weirdos out there. 
Oh, I am planning on doing a lot of kissing ... ... and fornicating so ... 
... you'd really be helping me out. 
Great. 
Page 32/51

Wh ... what ... do you mean now? - I tought, ... 
- Yeah, I did but ... 
We could, let's do it now. 
- I mean,

Um, my hands on you ... 
Staying here ... 
Hold steady ... 
Fuck ! I'm sorry. 
I tought I was gonna pass out ... Carry on ... 
- How's that mate? 
- Nothin' nothin', just hangin' around. They were about to make out. 
It was awkward ! ... 
We were just ... 
Good ... 
Please put your shorts on Paul. You guys partake? 
No, thank you. 
I'll partake. 
Are you sure? 
It's pretty strong shit. 
I got it from the military actually. This is the stuff that killed Dylan. Bob Dylan is not dead. 
Isn't he? 
Hit me. 
Ok, just ... you know ... go easy on it. Ruth ... 
A little bit, a little bit. 
It's not so bad. 
To be fair, it takes a while 
to be absorbed in. 
Oh, shit ... 
I'm hungry. We should 
cook up some saussages. 
Do we have any saussages? 
What do you mean by that? 
Why do you guys hate me? 
Can we go cook up 
some saussages? 
Oh, I have waspes in my brain ! Page 33/51

She'll be fine ... 
That happened to me the first time. Paul ... 
I was gonna ask ... 
you know us right? 
Yeah, Graeme we're 
like modified BFF. 
Why are you in such 
a hurry to leave now? 
Well, according to the Government, I fulfilled my usefulness. 
I told them eveything I know, 
the only thing I've left off for them now ... ... are my abilities. 
The healing, the thought transfer, the camouflage. 
In order to cultivate those abilities, they need some of my stem cells. 
And I'm not really down with that. Lucky for me, I do have 
one friend left on the inside. 
So, a man should get 
SOS a beamed into space ... 
... I got my people primed 
and ready to pick me up. 
Then, motherfuckers brought the 
procedure forward by a day ... 
... and my whole plan goes to shit ! What happened? 
The way at the labs? 
I zapped my ass, I stole his car 
I took off. 
Found you guys. 
So what happends if you get cought? Graeme ... 
They're gonna cut out my brain. 
Oh ... 
Yeah, it's fucked. 
It's kind of a buzzkill. 
Let's lighten the mood shall we ... ... Clive, when did you last get laid? Oh, hmm ... 
- Connect many at London(?) '08 
- '08 ...

Hey Clive ...

False economy anyway, you'll 
break the fist time you use it, let's go. Why would I ever use it? 
Can we just go please? 
Wait ... maybe we should go inside. - What ?!

You go back and get Ruth. 
Get the RV, pick us up in 10 minutes. You sure? 
Trust me ...

I've spent a very 
long time trying to ... 
... convince folks about what 
happened that night. 
Everyone said I was mad ! 
They told me it was a meteor that squashed little Paul. 
They said that I was 
concussed hallucinating ... 
... but I knew you were real ! 
I pulled you from that 
spaceship myself. 
I kept you warm and 
comfartable and sat there ... 
... with you 'til the 
men came to take you away. 
Well, word got 
out about my story. 
Page 42/51
Kids used to come and 
throw stones at the house. 
Call me names. 
Then, I just hid myself away. 
I spent whole nights up 
staring at the sky hoping ... 
... that I catch a glimpse of you. And here you are. 
Um, I'm sorry, you know 
if I could've done it any other way ... Oh, it's ok. 
You're real. 
That's all that matters. 
I was sure of it. 
And all those folks that ... 
... said I was crazy, they 
can all go and fuck themselves. I brought something for you. 
I thought you might want it back. Uh, here you go. 
Oh, thank you.

PAUL: 
Clive Gollings



Once upon a time 
in a kingdom far, far away, 
the king and queen were blessed 
with a beautiful baby girl. 
And throughout the land, 
everyone was happy... 
until the sun went down 
and they saw that their daughter was cursed with a frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night. Desperate, they sought the help 
of a fairy godmother 
who had them lock the young princess away in a tower, 
there to await the kiss... 
of the handsome Prince Charming. It was he who would chance 
the perilous journey 
through blistering cold 
and scorching desert 
traveling for many days and nights, risking life and limb 
to reach the Dragon's keep. 
For he was the bravest, 
and most handsome... 
in all the land. 
And it was destiny that his kiss would break the dreaded curse. 
He alone would climb to the highest room of the tallest tower 
to enter the princess's chambers, cross the room to her sleeping silhouette, pull back the gossamer curtains 
to find her... 
What? 
- Princess... Fiona? 
- No! 
Oh, thank heavens. 
Where is she? 
- She's on her honeymoon. 
- Honeymoon? With whom? 
- She's on her honeymoon. 
- Honeymoon? With whom? 
So she said 
Page 2/44
what's the problem, baby? 
What's the problem? 
I don't know 
Well, maybe I'm in love 
Think about it 
every time I think 'bout it 
Can't stop thinking 'bout it 
How much longer 
will it take to cure this? 
Just to cure it, 
'cause I can't ignore it 
If it's love, love 
Makes me wanna turn around 
and face me 
But I don't know nothing 
'bout love 
Oh, come on, come on 
- Turn a little faster 
Come on, come on 
The world will follow after 
Come on, come on 
Everybody's after love 
So I said 
I'm a snowball running 
Running down into this spring 
that's coming all this love 
Melting under blue skies 
belting out sunlight 
Shimmering love 
Well, baby, I surrender 
To the strawberry ice cream 
Never ever end of all this love Well, I didn't mean to do it 
But there's no escaping your love These lines of lightning 
mean we're never alone 
Never alone, no, no 
Come on, come on 
Jump a little higher 
Come on, come on 
If you feel a little lighter 
Come on, come on 
We were once upon a time in love Hyah! 
Page 3/44
We're accidentally in love 
Accidentally in love

lt's so good to be home! 
Just you and me and... 
- Two can be as bad as one... 
- Donkey? 
Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you two 
a sight for sore eyes! 
Give us a hug, Shrek, 
you old love machine. 
And look at you, Mrs. Shrek. 
How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed? Donkey, what are you doing here? Taking care of your love nest for you. Oh, you mean like... sorting the mail and watering the plants? 
- Yeah, and feeding the fish! 
- l don't have any fish. 
You do now. l call that one Shrek and the other Fiona. 
That Shrek is a rascally devil. 
Get your... 
Look at the time. 
l guess you'd better be going. 
Don't you want to tell me about your trip? Or how about a game of Parcheesi? Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be getting home to Dragon? 
Oh, yeah, that. 
l don't know. 
She's been all moody and stuff lately. l thought l'd move in with you. 
Page 4/44
You know we're always happy 
to see you, Donkey. 
But Fiona and l are married now. We need a little time, you know, to be together. 
Just with each other. 
Alone. 
Say no more. 
You don't have to worry about a thing. l will always be here to make sure nobody bothers you. 
- Donkey! 
- Yes, roomie? 
You're bothering me. 
Oh, OK. All right, cool. l guess... Me and Pinocchio was going to catch a tournament, anyway, so... 
Maybe l'll see y'all Sunday 
for a barbecue or something. 
He'll be fine. 
Now, where were we? 
Oh. 
l think l remember. 
- Donkey! 
l know, l know! Alone! 
l'm going! l'm going. 
What do you want me 
to tell these other guys? 
Enough, Reggie. 
''Dearest Princess Fiona. 
''You are hereby summoned 
to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away ''for a royal ball 
in celebration of your marriage ''at which time the King 
''will bestow his royal blessing... upon you and your...'' 
uh... ''Prince Charming. 
''Love, the King and Queen 
of Far, Far Away. 
''aka Mom and Dad.'' 
Mom and Dad? 
- Prince Charming? 
- Royal ball? Can l come? 
Page 5/44
- We're not going. 
- What? 
l mean, don't you think 
they might be a bit... 
shocked to see you like this? 
Well, they might be 
a bit surprised. 
But they're my parents, Shrek. They love me. 
And don't worry. 
They'll love you, too. 
Yeah, right. 
Somehow l don't think l'll be welcome at the country club. 
Stop it. 
They're not like that. 
How do you explain Sergeant Pompous and the Fancy Pants Club Band? Oh, come on! You could at least give them a chance. 
To do what? 
Sharpen their pitchforks? 
No! They just want 
to give you their blessing. 
Oh, great. 
Now l need their blessing? 
lf you want to be a part 
of this family, yes! 
Who says l want 
to be part of this family? 
You did! 
When you married me! 
Well, there's some fine print for you! So that's it. You won't come? 
Trust me. lt's a bad idea. 
We are not going! And that's final! Come on! 
We don't want to hit traffic! 
Don't worry! 
We'll take care of everything. - Hey, wait for me. Oof! 
Hit it! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Head 'em up, move 'em on! Head 'em up! Rawhide! Move 'em on! 
Page 6/44
Head 'em up! 
Move 'em on! Move 'em on!

Ride 'em up! Move 'em on! 
Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Rawhide! Knock 'em out! Pound 'em dead! 
Make 'em tea! Buy 'em drinks! 
Meet their mamas! 
Milk 'em hard! 
Rawhide! 
Yee-haw! 
- Are we there yet? 
- No. 
- Are we there yet? 
- Not yet. 
- OK, are we there yet? 
- No. 
- Are we there yet? 
- No! 
- Are we there yet? 
- Yes.

- Are we there yet? 
- No! 
- Are we there yet? 
- We are not! 
- Are we there yet? 
- No! 
- Are we there yet? 
- That's not funny. That's really immature. - This is why nobody likes ogres. - Your loss! 
- l'm gonna just stop talking. 
- Finally! 
This is taking forever, Shrek. 
There's no in-flight movie or nothing! The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey. That's where we're going. 
Far, far... 
away! 
All right, all right, l get it. 
l'm just so darn bored. 
Well, find a way 
Page 7/44
to entertain yourself. 
For five minutes... 
Could you not be yourself... 
...for five minutes! 
Are we there yet? 
- Yes! 
- Oh, finally! 
Wow! 
lt's going to be champagne wishes and caviar dreams from now on. 
Hey, good-looking! 
We'll be back to pick you up later! Gotta make a move 
to a town that's right for me 
We are definitely not 
in the swamp anymore. 
Halt! 
Well, I talk about it, talk about it, talk about it, talk about it 
Hey, everyone, look.

Announcing the long-awaited return of the beautiful Princess Fiona and her new husband. 
Well, this is it. 
- This is it. 
- This is it. 
This is it. 
Uh... why don't you guys go ahead? l'll park the car. 
So... 
you still think 
this was a good idea? 
Of course! Look. 
Mom and Dad look happy to see us. - Who on earth are they? 
- l think that's our little girl. That's not little! 
That's a really big problem. 
Wasn't she supposed to kiss 
Page 8/44
Prince Charming and break the spell? Well, he's no Prince Charming, 
but they do look... 
Happy now? 
We came. We saw them. 
Now let's go before 
they light the torches. 
- They're my parents. 
- Hello? They locked you in a tower. That was for my own... 
Good! Here's our chance. Let's go 
back inside and pretend we're not home. Harold, we have to be... 
Quick! While they're not looking 
we can make a run for it. 
Shrek, stop it! 
Everything's gonna be... 
A disaster! There is no way... 
- You can do this. 
- l really... 
- Really... 
- don't... want... to... be... 
Here! 
Mom... Dad... 
l'd like you to meet my husband... Shrek. 
Well, um... 
lt's easy to see where Fiona 
gets her good looks from. 
- Excuse me. 
Better out than in, 
l always say, eh, Fiona? 
That's good. 
l guess not. 
What do you mean, ''not on the list''? Don't tell me you don't know who l am. What do you mean, ''not on the list''? Don't tell me you don't know who l am. What's happening, everybody? 
Thanks for waiting. 
- l had the hardest time finding this place. - No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down! 
No, Dad! lt's all right. 
lt's all right. He's with us. 
Page 9/44

- He helped rescue me from the dragon. 
- That's me: 
Waiter! 
How 'bout a bowl for the steed? Oh, boy. 
- Um, Shrek? 
- Yeah? 
Oh, sorry! 
Great soup, Mrs Q. 
Mmm! 
No, no. Darling. 
Oh! 
So, Fiona, tell us 
about where you live. 
Well... 
Shrek owns his own land. 
- Don't you, honey? 
- Oh, yes! 
lt's in an enchanted forest 
abundant in squirrels 
and cute little duckies and... What? 
l know you ain't 
talking about the swamp. 
An ogre from a swamp. 
Oh! How original. 
l suppose that would be a fine place to raise the children. 
lt's a bit early to be 
thinking about that, isn't it? - lndeed. l just started eating. - Harold! 
- What's that supposed to mean? - Dad. lt's great, OK? 
- For his type, yes. 
- My type? 
l got to go to the bathroom. 
- Dinner is served! 
- Never mind. l can hold it. 
Bon appetit! 
Oh, Mexican food! 
My favorite. 
Let's not sit here with our tummies Page 10/44

rumbling. Everybody dig in. 
Don't mind if l do, Lillian. 
l suppose any grandchildren 
l could expect from you would be... Ogres, yes! 
Not that there's anything wrong with that. Right, Harold? 
Oh, no! No! Of course, not! 
That is, assuming you don't 
eat your own young! 
Dad! 
No, we usually prefer the ones 
who've been locked away in a tower! - Shrek, please! 
- l only did that because l love her. Aye, day care 
or dragon-guarded castle. 
You wouldn't understand. 
You're not her father! 
lt's so nice to have the family 
together for dinner.

- Shrek!

Look... 
Thank you very much, 
Fairy Godmother, 
but l really don't need all this. - Fine. Be that way. 
Page 12/44
- We didn't like you, anyway. 
- Fiona? Fiona? 
Oh! You got a puppy? 
All l got in my room was shampoo. Oh, uh... 
Fairy Godmother, furniture... 
l'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek. Your husband? What? What did you say? When did this happen? 
Shrek is the one who rescued me. - But that can't be right. 
- Oh, great, more relatives! 
She's just trying to help. 
Good! She can help us pack. 
Get your coat, dear. We're leaving. - What? 
- l don't want to leave. 
When did you decide this? 
- Shortly after arriving. 
- Look, l'm sorry... 
No, that's all right. 
l need to go, anyway. 
But remember, dear. 
lf you should ever need me... 
happiness... 
is just a teardrop away. 
Thanks, but we've got all 
the happiness we need. 
Happy, happy, happy... 
So l see. 
Let's go, Kyle. 
- Very nice, Shrek. 
- What? 
l told you coming here was a bad idea. You could've at least tried 
to get along with my father. 
l don't think l was going to get Daddy's blessing, 
even if l did want it. 
Do you think it might be nice 
if somebody asked me what l wanted? Sure. Do you want me 
to pack for you? 
You're unbelievable! 
Page 13/44
You're behaving like a... 
- Go on! Say it! 
- Like an ogre! 
Here's a news flash for you! 
Whether your parents like it or not... l am an ogre! 
And guess what, Princess? 
That's not about to change. 
l've made changes for you, Shrek. Think about that. 
That's real smooth, Shrek. 
''l'm an ogre!'' 
l knew this would happen. 
You should. 
You started it. 
l can hardly believe that, Lillian. He's the ogre. Not me. 
l think, Harold, you're taking this a little too personally. 
This is Fiona's choice. 
But she was supposed to choose 
the prince we picked for her. 
l mean, you expect me to give 
my blessings to this... thing? 
Fiona does. 
And she'll never forgive you if you don't. l don't want to lose 
our daughter again, Harold. 
Oh, you act as if love 
is totally predictable. 
Don't you remember when 
we were young? 
We used to walk 
down by the lily pond and... 
- they were in bloom... 
- Our first kiss. 
lt's not the same! 
l don't think you realize that 
our daughter has married a monster! Oh, stop being such a drama king. Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong! La, di, da, di, da! 
lsn't it all wonderful! 
l'd like to know 
Page 14/44
how it could get any worse! 
- Hello, Harold. 
- What happened? 
- Nothing, dear! 
Just the old crusade wound 
playing up a bit! 
l'll just stretch it 
out here for a while. 
You better get in. 
We need to talk. 
Actually, Fairy Godmother, 
off to bed. 
Already taken my pills, 
and they tend to make me a bit drowsy. So, how about... we make this 
a quick visit. What? 
Oh, hello. 
Ha-ha-ha! 
So, what's new? 
You remember my son, 
Prince Charming? 
ls that you? My gosh! 
lt's been years. 
When did you get back? 
Oh, about five minutes ago, actually. After l endured blistering winds, scorching desert... 
l climbed to the highest room 
in the tallest tower... 
Mommy can handle this. 
He endures blistering winds 
and scorching desert! 
He climbs to the highest bloody room of the tallest bloody tower... And what does he find? 
Some gender-confused wolf 
telling him that his princess 
is already married. 
lt wasn't my fault. 
He didn't get there in time. 
Stop the car! 
Harold. 
You force me to do something 
l really don't want to do. 
Page 15/44

Where are we? 
Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy! May l take your order? 
My diet is ruined! 
l hope you're happy. Er... okay. Two Renaissance Wraps, 
no mayo... chili rings... 
- l'll have the Medieval Meal. 
- One Medieval Meal and, Harold... - Curly fries? 
- No, thank you. 
- Sourdough soft taco, then? 
- No, really, l'm fine. 
Your order, Fairy Godmother. 
This comes with the Medieval Meal. There you are, dear. 
We made a deal, Harold, and l assume you don't want me to go back on my part. lndeed not. 
So, Fiona and Charming will be together. - Yes. 
- Believe me, Harold. lt's what's best. Not only for your daughter... 
but for your Kingdom. 
What am l supposed to do about it? Use your imagination. 
Oh... 
Come on in, Your Majesty. 
I like my town 
With a little drop of poison 
Nobody knows... 
Excuse me. 
Do l know you? 
No, you must be mistaking me 
for someone else. 
Uh... excuse me. 
l'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister. Ah! There you are. Right. 
You see, l need to have 
someone taken care of. 
- Who's the guy? 
- Well, he's not a guy, per se. Um... He's an ogre. 
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in. Page 16/44
There's only one fellow who can handle a job like that, and, frankly... he don't like to be disturbed. he don't like to be disturbed. Where could l find him? 
Hello? 
Who dares enter my room? 
Sorry! l hope l'm not interrupting, but l'm told you're the one to talk to about an ogre problem? 
You are told correct. 
But for this, l charge 
a great deal of money. 
Would... this be enough? 
You have engaged my valuable 
services, Your Majesty. 
Just tell me where 
l can find this ogre. 
Everyone says 
I'm getting down too low 
Everyone says 
you've just gotta let it go 
You just gotta let it go 
I need some sleep 
Time to put the old horse down I'm in too deep 
And the wheels keep spinning round Everyone says 
you've just gotta let it go 
Everyone says 
you've just gotta let it go 
Dear Knight, I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. Dear Diary... 
Sleeping Beauty is having 
a slumber party tomorrow, 
but Dad says I can't go. 
He never lets me out after sunset. Dad says I'm going away for a while. Must be like some finishing school. Mom says that when I'm old enough, my Prince Charming will rescue me from my tower 
and bring me back to my family, Page 17/44

and we'll all live 
happily ever after. 
Mrs. Fiona Charming. 
Mrs. Fiona Charming. 
Mrs. Fiona Charming. 
Mrs. Fiona Charming. 
Sorry. l hope l'm not 
interrupting anything. 
No, no. l was just reading a, uh... a scary book. 
l was hoping you'd let me apologize for my despicable behavior earlier. - Okay... 
- l don't know what came over me. Do you suppose we could pretend it never happened and start over... - Look, Your Majesty, l just... - Please. Call me Dad. 
Dad. We both acted like ogres. Maybe we just need some time 
to get to know each other. 
Excellent idea! l was actually hoping you might join me for a morning hunt. A little father-son time? 
l know it would mean 
the world to Fiona. 
Shall we say, 
Face it, Donkey! 
We're lost. 
We can't be lost. We followed 
the King's instructions exactly. ''Head to the 
darkest part of the woods...'' ''Past the sinister trees 
with scary-looking branches.'' - The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey! - We passed that three times already! You were the one who said 
not to stop for directions. 
Oh, great. My one chance 
to fix things up with Fiona's dad and l end up lost 
in the woods with you! 
Don't get huffy! 
Page 18/44
l'm only trying to help. 
l know! l know. 
- l'm sorry, all right? 
- Hey, don't worry about it. 
l just really need to make 
things work with this guy. 
Yeah, sure. Now let's go 
bond with Daddy. 
Well, well, well, Donkey. 
l know it was kind of a tender 
moment back there, but the purring? What? l ain't purring. 
Sure. What's next? A hug? 
Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr. What do you think l am, some kind of a... Ha-ha! 
Fear me, if you dare! 
Look! A little cat. 
- Look out, Shrek! He got a piece! - lt's a cat, Donkey. 
Come here, 
little kitty, kitty. 
Come on, little kitty. Come here. Oh! Come here, little kitty. 
- Whoa! 
- Hold on, Shrek! l'm coming! 
- Come on! Get it off! Get it off! Oh God. Oh... 
No! 
- Look out, Shrek! Hold still! 
- Get it off! 
Shrek! Hold still! 
- Did l miss? 
- No. You got them. 
Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from... Puss... in Boots! 
l'll kill that cat! 
Ah-ha-ha! 
Hairball. 
- Oh! That is nasty! 
What should we do with him? 
Take the sword and neuter him. 
Give him the Bob Barker treatment. Oh, no! Por favor! 
Page 19/44
Please! 
l implore you! 
lt was nothing personal, Senor. l was doing it only for my family. My mother, she is sick. 
And my father lives off the garbage! The King offered me much in gold and l have a litter of brothers... Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
Fiona's father paid you to do this? The rich King? Si. 
Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing. Don't feel bad. Almost everybody that meets you wants to kill you. Gee, thanks. 
Maybe Fiona would've been better off if l were some sort of Prince Charming. That's what the King said. 
Oh, uh... sorry. l thought that question was directed at me. 
Shrek, Fiona knows 
you'd do anything for her. 
Well, it's not like 
l wouldn't change if l could. 
l just... l just wish 
l could make her happy. 
Hold the phone... 
''Happiness.'' 
''A tear drop away.'' 
Donkey! Think of the saddest thing that's ever happened to you! 
Aw, man, where do l begin? 
First there was the time that old farmer tried to sell me for some magic beans. Then this fool had a party and he have the guests trying to pin the tail on me. Then they got drunk and start beating me with a stick, going ''Pinata!!'' What is a pinata, anyway? 
No, Donkey! l need you to cry! 
Don't go projecting on me. 
l know you're feeling bad, 
but you got to... 
Aaaahhh! 
Page 20/44
You little, hairy, 
litter-licking sack of... 
What? Is it on? Is it on? 
This is Fairy Godmother. 
I'm either away 
from my desk or with a client. But if you come by the office, we'll be glad to make you an appointment. Have a ''happy ever after. '' 
Oh... 
Are you up for a little quest, Donkey? That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey, on another whirlwind adventure! Ain't no stoppin' us now! Whoo! We're on the move! 
- Stop, Ogre! l have misjudged you. - Join the club. We've got jackets. On my honor, l am obliged to accompany you until l have saved your life as you have spared me mine. 
The position of annoying talking animal has already been taken. 
Let's go, Shrek. Shrek? 
- Shrek! 
- Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him... in his wee little boots. 
You know, how many cats can wear boots? Honestly. 
- Let's keep him! 
- Say what? 
Ahh! 
Listen. He's purring! 
- Oh, so now it's cute. 
- Come on, Donkey. Lighten up. Lighten up? l should lighten up? Look who's telling who to lighten up! Lighten up? l should lighten up? Look who's telling who to lighten up! Shrek! 
Shrek? 
They're both festive, aren't they? What do you think, Harold? 
Um... Yes, yes. 
Fine. Fine. 
Page 21/44
Try to at least pretend you're interested in your daughter's wedding ball. Honestly, Lillian, 
l don't think it matters. 
How do we know there will 
even be a ball? 
Mom. Dad. 
- Oh, hello, dear. 
- What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming. Mom, have you seen Shrek? 
l haven't. 
You should ask your father. 
Be sure and use small words, dear. He's a little slow this morning. - Can l help you, Your Majesty? - Ah, yes! Um... 
Mmm! Exquisite. 
What do you call this dish? 
That would be the dog's breakfast, Your Majesty. 
Ah, yes. Very good, then. 
Carry on, Cedric. 
- Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek? - No, l haven't, dear. 
l'm sure he just went off to look for a nice... mud hole to cool down in. You know, after your 
little spat last night. 
Oh. You heard that, huh? 
The whole kingdom heard you. 
l mean, after all, 
it is in his nature to be... 
well, a bit of a brute. 
Him? You know, you didn't exactly roll out the Welcome Wagon. 
Well, what did you expect? 
Look at what he's done to you. 
Shrek loves me for who l am. 
l would think you'd be happy for me. Darling, l'm just thinking about what's best for you. 
Maybe you should do the same. 
No, really? 
Shh... 
Page 22/44
Oh... 
Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place. Let's back away slowly. 
That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage. She's the largest producer of hexes and potions in the whole kingdom. 
Then why don't we pop in there 
for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell! 
He makes me laugh. 
Hi. l'm here to see the... 
The Fairy Godmother. 
l'm sorry. She is not in. 
Jerome! 
Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now! 
Yes, Fairy Godmother. 
Right away. 
Look, she's not seeing 
any clients today, OK? 
That's OK, buddy. 
We're from the union. 
The union? 
We represent the workers in all magical industries, both evil and benign. 
Oh! Oh, right. 
Are you feeling at all 
degraded or oppressed? 
Uh... a little. 
We don't even have dental. 
They don't even have dental. 
Okay, we'll just have 
a look around. 
Oh. By the way. 
l think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother didn't know we were here. 
- Know what l'm saying? Huh? 
- Huh? Huh? Huh? 
- Stop it. 
- Of course. Go right in. 
A drop of desire. 
Naughty! 
A pinch of passion. 
And just a hint of... 
lust! 
Excuse me. 
Page 23/44
Sorry to barge in like this... What in Grimm's name 
are you doing here? 
Well, it seems 
that Fiona's not exactly happy. Oh-ho-ho! 
And there's some question 
as to why that is? 
Well, let's explore that, shall we? Ah. P, P, P... 
Princess. Cinderella. 
Here we are. 
''Lived happily ever after.'' Oh... No ogres! 
Let's see. Snow White. 
A handsome prince. 
Oh, no ogres. 
Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres! Hansel and Gretel? No! 
Thumbelina? No. 
The Golden Bird, 
the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman... No, no, no, no, no! 
You see, ogres don't 
live happily ever after. 
All right, look, lady! 
Don't you point... 
those dirty green sausages at me! Your Monte Cristo and coffee. 
Oh! Sorry. 
Ah... that's okay. 
We were just leaving. 
Very sorry to have wasted your time, Miss Godmother. 
Just... go. 
Come on, guys. 
TGlF, eh, buddy? 
Working hard or hardly working, eh, Mac? 
Get your fine Corinthian footwear and your cat cheeks out of my face! Man, that stinks! 
You don't exactly smell like 
a basket of roses. 
Page 24/44
- Well, one of these has got to help. - l was just concocting this very plan! Already our minds are becoming one. Whoa, whoa. lf we need an expert on licking ourselves, we'll give you a call. Shrek, this is a bad idea. 
Look. Make yourself useful 
and go keep watch. 
Puss, do you think you 
could get to those on top? 
No problema, boss. 
ln one of my nine lives, 
l was the great cat burglar 
of Santiago de Compostela. 
Ha-ha-ha-ha! 
Shrek, are you off your nut? 
Donkey, keep watch. 
Keep watch? 
Yeah, l'll keep watch. 
l'll watch that wicked witch come and whammy a world of hurt up your backside. l'll laugh, too. 
l'll be giggling to myself. 
- What do you see? 
- Toad Stool Softener? 
l'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution for marital problems. 
- Elfa Seltzer? 
- Uh-uh. 
- Hex Lax? 
- No! Try ''handsome.'' 
Sorry. No handsome. 
Hey! How about ''Happily Ever After''? Well, what does it do? 
lt says ''Beauty Divine.'' 
ln some cultures, donkeys are revered as the wisest of creatures. 
Especially us talking ones. 
Donkey! 
That'll have to do. 
We've got company. 
Can we get on with this? 
Hurry! 
Nice catch, Donkey! 
Page 25/44
Finally! A good use for your mouth. Come on! 
You spurn my natural emotions 
You make me feel like dirt 
and I'm hurt 
And if I start a commotion 
I run the risk of losing you 
and that's worse 
Ever fallen in love with someone, ever fallen in love 
In love with someone, 
ever fallen in love 
In love with someone 
you shouldn't have fallen in love with Ever fallen in love with someone, ever fallen in love 
In love with someone, 
ever fallen in love 
With someone 
you shouldn't have fallen in love with Fallen in love with 
Ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't have fallen in love with l don't care whose fault it is. Just get this place cleaned up! And somebody bring me something deep fried and smothered in chocolate! - Mother! 
- Charming. Sweetheart. 
This isn't a good time, pumpkin. Mama's working. 
Whoa, what happened here? 
- The ogre, that's what! 
- What? Where is he, Mom? 
l shall rend his head 
from his shoulders! 
l will smite him where he stands! He will rue the very day he stole my kingdom from me! 
Oh, put it away, Junior! 
You're still going to be king. We'll just have to come up 
with something smarter. 
Pardon. Um... 
Page 26/44
Everything is accounted for, 
Fairy Godmother, except for one potion. What? 
Oh... 
l do believe we can make 
this work to our advantage. 
''Happily Ever After Potion. 
Maximum strength. 
''For you and your true love. 
''lf one of you drinks this, 
you both will be fine. 
''Happiness, comfort 
and beauty divine.'' 
- You both will be fine? 
- l guess it means it'll affect Fiona, too. Hey, man, this don't feel right. 
My donkey senses are tingling all over. Drop that jug o' voodoo 
and let's get out of here. 
lt says, ''Beauty Divine.'' 
How bad can it be? 
See, you're allergic to that stuff. You'll have a reaction. 
And if you think that l'll be smearing Vapor Rub over your chest, think again! Boss, just in case there is something wrong with the potion... 
allow me to take the first sip. 
lt would be an honor to lay my life on the line for you. 
Oh, no, no. l don't think so. 
lf there'll be any animal testing, l'll do it. 
That's the best friend's job. 
Now give me that bottle. 
How do you feel? 
l don't feel any different. 
l look any different? 
You still look like an ass to me. Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys. - Well, here's to us, Fiona. 
- Shrek? 
- You drink that, there's no going back. - l know. 
Page 27/44
- No more wallowing in the mud? - l know. 
- No more itchy butt crack? 
- l know! 
- But you love being an ogre! 
- l know! 
But l love Fiona more. 
Shrek, no! Wait! 
Got to be... l think you grabbed the ''Farty Ever After'' potion. Maybe it's a dud. 
Or maybe Fiona and l 
were never meant to be. 
Or maybe Fiona and l 
were never meant to be. 
Uh-oh. What did l tell you? 
l feel something coming on. 
l don't want to die. 
l don't want to die. l don't want to die! Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy. l'm melting! 
l'm melting! 
lt's just the rain, Donkey. 
Oh. 
Don't worry. Things seem bad 
because it's dark and rainy 
and Fiona's father hired 
a sleazy hitman to whack you. 
lt'll be better in the morning. You'll see... 
The sun'll come out... 
Tomorrow 
Bet your bottom... 
Bet my bottom? 
l'm coming, Elizabeth! 
Donkey? 
Are you all right? 
- Hey, boss. Let's shave him. 
- D-Donkey? 
There you are! 
We missed you at dinner. 
What is it, darling? 
Dad... 
l've been thinking 
Page 28/44
about what you said. 
And l'm going to set things right. Ah! Excellent! 
That's my girl. 
lt was a mistake to bring Shrek here. l'm going to go out and find him. And then we'll go back 
to the swamp where we belong. 
Fiona, please! 
Let's not be rash, darling. 
You can't go anywhere right now. Fiona! 
Look, l told you he was here. 
Look at him! Quiet. Look at him. Good morning, sleepyhead. 
Good morning! 
We love your kitty! 
Oh... My head... 
- Here, l fetched a pail of water. Thanks. 
Uhh! 
Aahh! 
Oh... 
A cute button nose? 
Thick, wavy locks? 
Taut, round buttocks? 
l'm... l'm... 
- Gorgeous! 
- l'll say. 
l'm Jill. What's your name? 
- Um... Shrek. 
- Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe? - You're tense. 
- l want to rub his shoulders. - l got it covered. 
- l don't have anything to rub. Get in line. 
Get in line. 
- Have you seen my donkey? 
- Who are you calling donkey? 
- Donkey? You're a... 
- A stallion, baby! 
l can whinny. 
l can count. 
Page 29/44
Look at me, Shrek! 
l'm trotting! 
That's some quality potion. 
What's in that stuff? 
''Oh, don't take the potion, 
Mr. Boss, it's very bad.'' 
Pah! 
''Warning: 
burning, itching, oozing, weeping. ''Not intended for heart patients or those with... nervous disorders.'' l'm trotting, l'm trotting in place! Yeah! What? 
Senor? ''To make the effects 
of this potion permanent, 
''the drinker must obtain his 
true love's kiss by midnight.'' 
Midnight? 
Why is it always midnight? 
- Pick me! l'll be your true love! - l'll be your true love. 
l'll be true... enough. 
Look, ladies, l already have a true love. Oh... 
And take it from me, Boss. 
You are going to have 
one satisfied Princess. 
And let's face it. 
You are a lot easier on the eyes. lnside you're the same 
old mean, salty... 
- Easy. 
- ...cantankerous, foul, 
angry ogre you always been. 
And you're still the same 
annoying donkey. 
- Yeah. 
Well... 
Look out, Princess. 
Here comes the new me.

Page 30/44
- Ready! 
- Driver, stop! 
Oh, God! Help me, please! 
My racing days are over! 
l'm blind! Tell the truth. 
Will l ever play the violin again? You poor creature! 
ls there anything 
l can do for you? 
Well, l guess there is one thing. Take off the powdered wig 
and step away from your drawers. - Not bad. 
- Not bad at all. 
Father? 
ls everything all right, Father? Thank you, gentlemen! 
Someday, l will repay you. 
Unless, of course, 
l can't find you or if l forget. Oh, yeah 
Turn and face the strange 
Ch-Ch-Changes 
Don't wanna be a richer one 
Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes 
Turn and face the strange 
Ch-Ch-Changes 
Just gonna have to be 
a different man 
Time may change me 
But I can't trace time 
Halt! 
Tell Princess Fiona her husband, Sir Shrek, is here to see her. Still don't know what 
I was looking for 
And my time was running wild, 
a million dead-end streets 
Every time I thought 
I'd got it made 
It seemed the taste 
was not so sweet 
- Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes 
Turn and face the strange 
Page 31/44
- Shrek? 
- Ch-Ch-Changes 
Don't wanna be a richer one 
Time may change me 
But I can't trace time 
Fiona? 
Hello, handsome. 
Shrek! 
- Princess! 
- Donkey? 
Wow! That potion 
worked on you, too? 
What potion? 
Shrek and l took some magic potion. And well... 
Now, we're sexy! 
Shrek? 
For you, baby... l could be. 
- Yeah, you wish. 
- Donkey, where is Shrek? 
He went inside looking for you. Shrek? 
Fiona! Fiona! 
You want to dance, pretty boy? Are you going so soon? 
Don't you want to see your wife? Fiona? 
Shrek? 
Aye, Fiona. lt is me. 
What happened to your voice? 
The potion changed 
a lot of things, Fiona. 
But not the way l feel about you. Fiona? 
- Charming? 
- Do you think so? 
Dad. l was so hoping 
you'd approve. 
- Um... Who are you? 
- Mom, it's me, Shrek. 
l know you never get a second chance at a first impression, 
but, well, what do you think? 
Fiona! Fiona! 
Page 32/44
Fiona! 
- Fiona! 
- Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho! 
Oh, shoot! l don't think they 
can hear us, pigeon. 
Don't you think you've already messed her life up enough? 
l just wanted her to be happy. And now she can be. 
Oh, sweetheart. 
She's finally found 
the prince of her dreams. 
But look at me. 
Look what l've done for her. 
lt's time you stop living 
in a fairy tale, Shrek. 
She's a princess, 
and you're an ogre. 
That's something no amount 
of potion will ever change. 
But... 
l love her. 
lf you really love her... 
you'll let her go. 
Shrek? 
Senor. 
What's going on? 
Where are you going? 
You wouldn't have had anything to do with this, would you, Harold? 
People just ain't no good 
I think that's well understood There you go, boys. 
Just leave the bottle, Doris. 
Hey. Why the long face? 
lt was all just a stupid mistake. l never should have rescued her from that tower in the first place. l hate Mondays. 
l can't believe you'd walk away from the best thing that happened to you. What choice do l have? 
She loves that pretty boy, 
Prince Charming. 
Page 33/44

Come on. ls he really 
that good-looking? 
Are you kidding? 
He's gorgeous! 
He has a face that looks like 
it was carved by angels. 
- Oh. He sounds dreamy. 
- You know... 
shockingly, this isn't 
making me feel any better. 
Look, guys. 
lt's for the best. 
Mom and Dad approve, 
and Fiona gets the man 
she's always dreamed of. 
Everybody wins. 
Except for you. 
l don't get it, Shrek. 
You love Fiona. 
Aye. 
And that's why 
l have to let her go. 
Excuse me, is she here? 
She's, uh... in the back. 
Oh, hello again. 
Fairy Godmother. Charming. 
You'd better have a good reason 
for dragging us down here, Harold. Well, l'm afraid Fiona isn't really... warming up to Prince Charming. 
- FYl, not my fault. 
- No, of course it's not, dear. 
l mean, 
how charming can l be 
when l have to pretend 
l'm that dreadful ogre? 
No, no, it's nobody's fault. 
Perhaps it's best if we just 
call the whole thing off, okay? 
- What? 
- You can't force someone to fall in love! l beg to differ. 
l do it all the time! 
Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall in love Page 34/44

with the first man she kisses, 
which will be Charming. 
- Umm... no. 
- What did you say? 
l can't. l won't do it. 
Oh, yes, you will. 
lf you remember, l helped you 
with your happily ever after. 
And l can take it away 
just as easily. 
ls that what you want? ls it? 
- No. 
- Good boy. 
Now, we have to go. 
l need to do Charming's hair 
before the ball. 
He's hopeless. 
He's all high in the front. 
He can never get to the back. 
You need someone to do the back. Oh. Thank you, Mother. 
Mother? 
Um... Mary! A talking horse! 
The ogre! 
Stop them! Thieves! Bandits! 
Stop them! 
The abs are fab 
and it's gluteus to the maximus 
here at tonight's Far, Far Away 
Royal Ball blowout! 
The coaches are lined up 
as the cream of the crop pours out of them like Miss Muffet's curds and whey. Everyone who's anyone 
has turned out 
to honor Princess Fiona 
and Prince Shrek. 
And, oh my, 
the outfits look gorgeous! 
Look! Hansel and Gretel! 
What the heck are the crumbs for? And right behind them, 
Tom Thumb and Thumbelina! 
- Oh, aren't they adorable! 
Page 35/44
Here comes Sleeping Beauty! 
Tired old thing. 
Who's this? Who's this? 
Who is this? 
Oh. lt's the one, it's the only... lt's the Fairy Godmother! 
Hello, Far, Far Away! 
Can l get a whoop whoop? 
May all your endings be happy and... Well, you know the rest! 
We'll be right back with the Royal Far, Far Away Ball 
after these messages. 
l hate these ball shows. 
They bore me to tears. 
Flip over to Wheel Of Torture! l'm not flipping anywhere, sir, until l see Shrek and Fiona. 
Whizzes on you guys. 
Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing! No, to your left. Your left! 
- Tonight on ''Knights''... 
- Now here's a good show! 
We got a white bronco heading east into the forest. Requesting backup. It's time to teach these madcap mammals their ''devil may mare'' attitudes just won't fly. 
Why you grabbing me? 
Police brutality! 
l have to talk to Princess Fiona! - We warned you! 
- Ow! Ow! 
Did someone let the cat out of the bag? You capitalist pig dogs! 
- Catnip! 
- That's not mine. 
Find Princess Fiona! 
l'm a donkey! 
Tell her Shrek... 
l'm her husband, Shrek! 
Quick! Rewind it! 
l'm her husband, Shrek! Ow! 
Darling? 
Page 36/44
Ah. l thought l might 
find you here. 
How about a nice hot cup 
of tea before the ball? 
l'm not going. 
The whole Kingdom's turned out to celebrate your marriage. 
There's just one problem. 
That's not my husband. 
l mean, look at him. 
Yes, he is a bit different, 
but people change 
for the ones they love. 
You'd be surprised how much 
l changed for your mother. 
Change? 
He's completely lost his mind! Why not come down to the ball 
and give him another chance? 
You might find you like 
this new Shrek. 
But it's the old one 
l fell in love with, Dad. 
l'd give anything to have him back. Darling. That's mine. Decaf. 
Otherwise l'm up all night. 
Thanks. 
l got to get out of here! 
l got to get out of here! 
You can't lock us up like this! Let me go! 
What about my Miranda rights? 
You're supposed to say 
l have the right to remain silent. Nobody said l have the right 
to remain silent! 
You have the right to remain silent. What you lack is the capacity. l must hold on before l, too, 
go totally mad. 
Shrek? Donkey? 
Too late. 
Gingy! Pinocchio! 
Get us out of here! 
Page 37/44
Oh... 
Fire in ze hole! 
Look out below! 
Quick! Tell a lie! 
- What should l say? 
- Anything, but quick! 
Say something crazy like 
''l'm wearing ladies' underwear!'' l am wearing ladies' underwear. - Are you? 
- l most certainly am not! 
lt looks like you 
most certainly am are! 
- l am not! 
- What kind? 
- lt's a thong! 
- Oww! They're briefs! 
- Are not. 
- Are too! 
- Are not! 
- Are too! 
Here we go. Hang tight. 
Wait, wait, wait! 
Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey! 
Ow! 
- Excuse me? 
- What? Puss! 
Pardon me, would you 
mind letting me go? 
- Sorry, boss. 
- Quit messing around! 
We've got to stop that kiss! 
l thought you was going 
to let her go. 
l was, but l can't let them 
do this to Fiona. 
Boom! That's what l like to hear. Look who's coming around! 
lt's impossible! 
We'll never get in. 
The castle's guarded. 
There's a moat and everything! Folks, it looks like we're up chocolate creek without a Popsicle stick. 
Page 38/44
- What? 
- Do you still know the Muffin Man? Well, sure! 
He's down on Drury Lane. Why? 
Because we're gonna need flour. Lots and lots of flour. 
Gingy! 
Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man! We've got a big order to fill! lt's alive! 
Run, run, run, 
as fast you can! 
Go, baby, go! 
There it is, Mongo! 
To the castle! 
No, you great stupid pastry! 
Come on! 
Mongo! Down here! 
Look at the pony! 
That's right! Follow the pretty pony! Pretty pony wants to play 
at the castle! 
Pretty pony. 
Ladies and gentlemen. 
Presenting Princess Fiona 
and her new husband, Prince Shrek. Shrek, what are you doing? 
l'm just playing the part, Fiona. ls that glitter on your lips? 
Mm. Cherry flavored. 
Want to taste? 
- Ugh! What is with you? 
- But, Muffin Cake... 
C Minor, put it in C Minor. 
Ladies and gentlemen. 
l'd like to dedicate this song to... Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek. Fiona, my Princess. 
Will you honor me with a dance? Where have all the good men gone And where are all the gods? 
Dance! 
Where's the streetwise Hercules To fight the rising odds? 
Page 39/44
Since when do you dance? 
Fiona, my dearest, 
if there's one thing l know, 
it's that love is full of surprises. Late at night I toss and I turn And I dream of what I need 
Hit it! 
I need a hero 
All right, big fella! 
Let's crash this party! 
Man the catapults! 
Aim! Fire! 
- Brace yourselves! 
- Ooh! Purty! 
Not the gumdrop button! 
lncoming! 
Ha-ha! All right! 
Somewhere after midnight 
In my wildest fantasy 
Go, Mongo! Go! 
Man the cauldrons! 
After you, Mongo. 
- That's it! Heave-ho! 
- Watch out! 
Shrek! 
More heat, less foam! 
Up where the mountains 
Meet the heavens above 
Out where the lightning 
Splits the sea 
I could swear there is someone Somewhere watching me 
Heave! Ho! 
No...! 
Come on! 
Look out! 
- Be good. 
He needs me! 
Let me go! 
Donkey! 
Puss!

Aww...

And he's gotta be fast 
And he's gotta be fresh 
From the fight 
- I need a hero

You couldn't just go back to your swamp and leave well enough alone. 
- Now!

Whah!

Kiss her now! 
No! 
- Hi-ya!

to give her the potion! 
Well, l guess l gave her 
the wrong tea.

Ogres don't live happily ever after. Woo! 
Ha! 
Page 41/44
Oh, Dad!

No, no, he's right. 
l'm sorry. 
To both of you. 
l only wanted what 
was best for Fiona. 
But l can see now... 
she already has it. 
Shrek, Fiona... 
Will you accept 
an old frog's apologies... 
and my blessing? 
Harold? 
l'm sorry, Lillian. 
l just wish l could be 
the man you deserve. 
You're more that man today 
than you ever were... 
warts and all. 
Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion! Midnight! 
Fiona. ls this what you want? 
To be this way forever? 
- What? 
- Because if you kiss me now... we can stay like this. 
You'd do that? 
- For me? 
- Yes. 
l want what any princess wants. To live happily ever after... 
with the ogre l married. 
Whatever happens, 
l must not cry! 
You cannot make me cry! 
Page 42/44
Whoa! 
No. No, no. 
Aaah! Ow. 
Oh, no. 
Hey. You still look like 
a noble steed to me. 
Now, where were we? 
Oh. l remember. 
Hey! lsn't we supposed 
to be having a fiesta? 
Uno, dos, quatro, hit it! 
Puss and Donkey, y'all... 
She's into superstitions 
Black cats and voodoo dolls 
- Sing it, Puss! 
- I feel a premonition 
That girl's gonna make me fall Here we go! 
She's into new sensations 
New kicks in the candlelight 
She's got a new addiction 
For every day and night 
She'll make you take your clothes off And go dancing in the rain 
She'll make you live her crazy life But she'll take away your pain Like a bullet to your brain 
Upside inside out

Two more minutes 
before the end of the test. 
I know what you're thinking, 
my brother-- 
\"Why? Why would this man 
\"give us a test on 
the last day of school 
before summer starts?\" 
Well I'm going to tell you why. Because... 
the mind never sleeps. 
Can I get 
a witness? 
Hallelujah. 
Out of here. 
What's your hurry, my brother? Huh, my hurry 
is that it's now 
officially summer vacation 
and yet, 
I'm still looking at you. 
You're an amazing student. 
Page 5/71
I mean, you sit there, 
you get your 
test done first 
and you were 
concentrating so hard, 
I thought you were asleep. 
Next time make it 
more challenging. 
That's what I want 
to talk to you about. 
Challenges, potential, 
using your mind, 
'cause I'm worried about you. 
I'm worried about you, too. 
Have you seen yourself lately? The 'fro, the boots, 
and this jacket... 
You have 
a nice summer, Shaft. 
Yo, Dex, wait up. 
So, uh, how you think 
you did on your exam? 
Sorry, summer vacation 
That means that school, 
work or anything of that nature is now officially off limits 
for the next three months. 
Whoo! 
Nice car. 
This yours? 
No, it's my mom's, 
but she's away on 
business in New York. 
And she lets you drive this 
while she's out of town? 
No. 
Ed! 
Ed... Spatch, 
will you move? 
Ed... Ed! 
Ed, we have a delivery. 
But I don't do deliveries. 
You do for the time being. 
I fired O'Malley. 
Page 6/71
How come? 
Because the boy showed up 
to work without his pants. 
Oh. 
Now, please, make this delivery. The address is on the back. 
Oh. 
It shall be delivered. 
So what's your plan 
for the summer? 
Ha! Let me tell you, boy, 
I plan to wake up every 
day at around noon, 
then I'm going to 
lay out by the pool, 
order some Chinese food, 
maybe invite some fine 
females over to share 
an egg roll 
or two. 
Then I'm going to 
wake up the next day, 
do it all over again. 
Ha, ha! 
Know what I'm saying? 
Say, man, you're lucky. 
My folks is making me 
get a summer job. 
See, that's it right there. 
You got to explain things 
to parents. 
Like summer vacation. 
The key word there 
is \"va-ca-tion.\" 
See what I'm saying? 
Look out! 
Whoa! 
Page 7/71
Just get off the... 
My afro. 
My afro! 
Why?! 
Oh, brother Reed, 
you have messed up my afro. 
All right, don't worry, bro. 
Just be cool 
and let me handle this. 
All right, Jake? 
Jake? 
Jake! 
Oh, no. 
Oh, baby. 
Oh! 
Oh, no. 
Oh! Oh, my grill. 
Oh, Black Beauty, oh. 
Oh! 
Oh! 
See, when I left 
school today 
I didn't think I was going 
to run into you this summer. 
Or I didn't think you 
was going to run into me. 
I mean, just <i>run</i> 
into me like this. 
You're in trouble 
with me, young man. 
You're in trouble 
with me! 
No, listen, Mr. Wheat, 
listen. 
It wasn't my fault. 
See, this nut 
on some roller blades, 
he skated into my vision sight, and I couldn't 
see nothing, 
so I swerved... 
Roller blades? 
Roller blades?! 
And we was spinning 
Page 8/71
around like that... 
I don't want 
to hear it! 
...and then 
I couldn't control it... 
I don't want to hear it. 
Know how much 
that car cost me? 
No. 
Do you know? 
No. 
And that's just 
the base price! 
Check out 
the chrome, see? 
I waited four weeks 
for the chrome! 
You can't get chrome 
wheels at base price! 
See that leather? 
That's Detroit leather. 
That's Detroit leather. 
You got to order Detroit 
leather from Detroit! 
Huh? What's that tell you? 
They always get you 
with them extras. 
Give me your 
driver's license. 
Um... 
Give me your 
driver's license. 
Um, regarding my 
driver's license, 
I'd give it to you, but 
you're going to have to wait. 
For what? 
Oh, about a year. 
Oh, no. 
That-that's when 
I get one. 
No, no... 
When they 
put it in my hand. 
Page 9/71
You don't have 
a driver's license? 
No. 
I know you don't have 
no insurance, do you? 
I guess... 
I hate to do this, 
young man. 
I hate to put a 
black man in jail, 
but I'm going to have 
to call the police. 
Black man in jail? 
You ain't got the... 
I'm just a kid. 
No, no, no, 
not the police. 
Don't call the police. 
No, please, don't call them. 
Don't call them. 
Please, don't call 
the police! 
They can't find out 
I was driving 
without a license, sir, 
please. 
No, please, 
let me fix it. 
Just let me, 
let me fix it, please. 
You shouldn't 
have been driving. 
No, let me fix it. 
Let me fix it! 
All right. 
All right? 
Yeah, all right. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, I'll let you 
fix the car. 
So, uh, how much you think 
it's going to cost to fix? 
That's all right. 
Maybe your parents 
Page 10/71
will help you out. 
I'll just give them a call... 
Ooh, oh, um, wait. 
I'll get the money. 
You can't get the money. 
I know you got a summer, 
you just want to be free. 
We'll just call... 
No, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
I will... I'll... 
I'll... 
I'll... I'll... 
I'll... 
I'll get a summer job. 
Bun, patty, topping, sauce, assemble. Bun, patty, topping, sauce, 
assemble. 
Bun, patty, topping, 
sauce, assemble. 
Come here, little bun. 
Oh, beef patty. 
Okay, yeah. 
Ooh, that's nasty. 
All right. 
Yo, my man, 
can I borrow some lettuce? 
Can I borrow some... 
You. 
Who? 
You! Look at this mess. 
I, I can explain. 
See, I was trying to put 
the big old beef patty... 
oh, on the bottom half 
of the bun, you know, 
before the tomato 
gets all slippery 
with the... ooh, 
that's slippery. 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
And then, you know, 
the pickle bits was 
making me do the wrong... 
because they're, 
Page 11/71

they're flexible, 
they're not crunchy. 
And... 
Yo, man, back me up on this. 
Oh, again with 
the whistle. 
Shut up. Just be quiet. 
It'd be a lot more quiet 
if you stopped 
blowing the whistle. 
Watch your mouth, 
you pestiferous 
little maggot. 
Now, I'm familiar 
with the term \"maggot\" 
but... pestiferous? 
Burn this into the front row 
of your brain, chuckles. 
If there's one thing 
Kurt cannot stand 
it is an incompetent, 
bumbling, sloppy, 
fast food employee. 
Yum. 
Yeah. 
Ed! 
What are you doing inside 
the milk shake machine? 
Oh, trying to fix it. 
Did you turn on the switch? 
No. 
Ah. 
Whoo! 
Whoa... 
Yeah... 
Strawberry Jacuzzi. 
Oh! Oy-yoi-yoi-yoi-yoi-yoi... 
Oh-ho, oy-yoi! 
People, I'm fully stoked 
about being in charge 
of every single one of you. 
Within two years, 
Mondo Burger's going to be 
the <i>biggest</i> burger chain Page 12/71

on this planet. 
Oh, yeah. 
First we got to beat out 
our big competition across 
the street, Good Burger. 
From now on, 
your <i>life</i> is 
Mondo Burger. 
You can forget 
about your friends, 
you can forget 
about your family, 
because Kurt... is now both 
your mother and your father. 
Kurt must look 
awfully strange naked. 
Who said that? 
Who talked while Kurt 
was talking? 
It was him. 
He uttered something. 
Why, I should've known. 
Uh, I'm sorry I uttered. 
You think you're funny, 
don't you, bro? 
You know what? 
At Mondo Burger, 
there are no comedians. 
You mess with Kurt and 
you go into the grinder. 
Okay, now this grinder 
of yours, 
is it a real grinder 
or is it some kind of 
a metaphor? 
That's it, you're gone! 
<i>Adios,</i> TKO, historical. Wait, wait, wait. 
I-I won't be funny 
no more. See? 
Security! 
You ain't got to bring 
the man down here. 
Wait, one second. 
Page 13/71
Kurt, come on, please, 
I need this job. 
Take out the trash. 
\"Trash\"? 
Oh, now, look'ee here, p... 
Get this loser 
out of my face! 
\"Loser\"? 
Oh, now, you about to push me 
a little too far. 
You want a piece 
of me? 
Yeah, extra crispy, please. 
Oh, see, you 
lucky you brought 
your friends down here. 
Hey, man, is this really 
necessary? 
Kurt, please! 
I need this job! 
Please, I need this job. Please. Excuse me. 
Look, I ordered one Good Burger with <i>nothing</i> on it. 
That's what I gave you. 
No, you gave me 
a bun. 
Just a bun. 
Look, there's no meat in here. But you said you 
wanted nothing on it. 
Yes, well, I expected 
a meat patty! 
Dude, a meat patty is something. You said nothing. 
Fizz, is a meat patty 
something, 
or nothing? 
Uh... something? 
I win! 
All right, that rips it. 
I am reporting your name 
to the manager! 
The manager already 
Page 14/71
knows my name. 
Oh, I'll see you in hell! 
Okay. See you there. 
Such a nice guy; 
I don't know why 
he had to throw the 
bread everywhere. 
I mean, jeez. 
One more Good Shake. 
Good, good, 
keep them coming. 
Um, dude, don't you think 
you've had enough? 
Hey... 
Hey, you look familiar. 
Don't I know you from somewhere? Ever been to Australia? 
No. 
Me neither. 
I could've sworn I seen 
you someplace before. 
Hey, I know. 
Maybe I'm someone famous. 
You know, 
like a baseball player, 
or a pretty nurse. Huh. 
What? Man, what in the world 
are you talking about? 
Okay, okay, I give up. 
Who am I? 
I don't know who you are, 
or where I know you from, 
or why you think 
you're an attractive nurse. 
But I am sure I don't 
want to know you 
any longer. 
Now please, go away. 
I've had a very bad day. 
What's wrong? 
Were you bitten by a sheep? 
What?! 
Did you lose 
your trousers? 
Page 15/71
No! 
Look, you're an unusually 
bad guesser, 
so I'm going to go ahead 
and tell you why I'm upset. 
to fix some jerk's car, 
to fix my mother's car 
and I just got fired. 
Man. 
I can't believe Kurt fired me 
from Mondo Burger. 
I mean, he yelled at me, 
then he insulted me. 
He made fun of me. 
Boy, you must really suck. 
See, right about now, 
I'd slap you 
in your head, 
but I'm not quite sure 
that your brain would understand the concept of pain. 
Hey! 
Want to see my belly button? 
Well, it was 
very unusual 
to meet you... Ed. 
I'm going to go now 
and try to beg someone 
for a summer 
job, man. Bye. 
Wait. You could work 
here at Good Burger. 
Here? 
Yeah. Hey, Mr. Baily, 
this guy needs a job. 
Could he have one? 
No! 
See ya. 
Wait, wait, wait. 
Come on, Mr. Baily. 
He really needs one. 
He can do fries. 
Otis does fries. 
Yeah, 
Page 16/71
but look at him. 
How much longer 
could he possibly live? 
Yeah. 
Well... 
Have you ever worked in 
fast food before, uh... 
Uh, Dexter. Dexter Reed. 
And yes, I have worked 
in fast food. 
Yeah? How long? 
Nearly two days. 
Oh, well... 
Do you know how to drive 
a motor vehicle? 
Yes. 
I'm an excellent driver. 
Any accidents on your record? 
Not to your knowledge. 
All right, Dexter. 
I'm going to 
give you a shot. 
You're on deliveries. 
And you may have 
to pitch in 
and do some 
counter work. 
Okay. 
Cool! I'll teach him 
everything I know! 
Oh... God help me. 
I won't let you down. 
Hey, Fizz. 
This is Dexter. 
Fizz works drive-thru. 
Well, hi-de-ho, Dex. 
Uh, hi-de-ho, Fi. 
\"Fi\"? 
Wow, nobody's ever abbreviated my name before. 
I love that. 
Huh! 
Hey, and that's Otis. Huh. 
and still works 
Page 17/71
in fast food. Huh. 
I should've died years ago. 
Tough break. 
And there's Deedee. 
She's a 
veterinarian. 
Vegetarian. 
Oh. 
That means she 
doesn't eat fur. 
I won't wear fur. 
I don't eat meat. 
Hey, uh, Ed, 
wh-what is that? 
Oh, that's 
just Spatch. 
Let me show you. 
Come here. Huh. 
Hey, Spatch. 
Uh, Spatch isn't much of 
a \"people person.\" Huh. 
Aah! 
Mmm. 
Mmm. 
Mmm. 
You want to rinse that off? 
Uh... 
Well, hello. 
My name is Dexter. 
I'm your new coworker. 
Monique. 
Well, that's a nice outfit 
you got on there. 
And those stripes 
really bring out 
the color of your eyes. 
Yes. 
You can imagine how 
embarrassed I was 
when I came to work 
and saw everyone 
wearing the same thing. 
Oh, okay. 
Oh, I-I guess 
Page 18/71
I'll see you later then. 
Guess you will. 
Yo, man, who was that? 
She is all that. 
All what? 
N-Never mind. 
So, tell me, 
what am I going 
to be making my 
deliveries in? 
A van, a truck? 
There she is-- 
the Burger Mobile. Huh. 
Think you can handle her? 
I don't know. 
I never driven 
a sandwich before. 
Ha. Huh. 
Come on, I'll take 
you for a spin. 
A'ight. 
Huh. 
Now, uh, 
you can drive, right? 
I mean, you can read 
all the signs and stuff? 
Yeah! Now this is what 
I call fast food! Huh! 
Whoa, whoa! 
Hey, look out for..! 
That was a stop sign! 
Uh... no. 
Oh, man. 
Watch out for the...! 
Whoa! 
Hey! Hey! 
Get back here! 
Closing time at last. 
All right, let me see. 
five days a week. 
I should be able to pay off 
the car in, uh... 
Oh, another lifetime! 
Page 19/71
Man! This place 
is the most nauseating, 
pathetic hole I 
have ever seen. 
I mean, what kind 
of diseased maggot 
would even consider eating here? Welcome to Good Burger, 
home of the Good Burger. 
Can I take your order? Huh. 
Check it, boys. 
Right back there. 
It's the reject. 
Hey, check it, Ed. 
It's the Mondo idiot! 
Oh, well, nice to meet you, 
Mondo Idiot. 
I'm Ed. Huh. 
Well, Ed, you better watch 
your butt, man. 
Okay. 
Look, you got a purpose 
for being here? 
Yeah, I do. 
I just thought you 
Good Burger losers 
should be aware 
that tonight is the grand 
opening of Mondo Burger. 
The second we open 
our doors, Good Burger 
goes in the grinder. 
Again with this grinder. 
Look, man, 
you either order something, 
or you can get out of here. 
Yeah. Sure. 
You can take 
my order. 
I'll have the very last 
Good Burger to go. 
Oh, I give up. 
There is no way a guy can 
watch his own butt. Oh! 
Page 20/71
Yeah! 
Is everybody liking my party?! 
And now... 
I'm psyched to present 
to you people, 
Mondo Burger! 
And now, people, 
welcome to Mondo Burger. 
Um, Mr. Baily. 
Since we don't have any 
customers, or electricity... 
Yeah, yeah. 
I suppose we should all just, 
uh, go on home. 
Looks like Good Burger closed early tonight. Yep. And it think pretty soon, 
they'll be closed for good. 
Everybody, I got one. 
Got one, what? 
What? What? 
A Mondo Burger. 
All right, 
all right, everybody. 
Page 21/71
Now, don't get 
all excitable. 
Holy Mackerel. 
It's huge. 
Look at that. 
And I don't know how they do it, but they charge the same amount as we do 
for a Good Burger. 
Whoa. 
How do they do it? 
They just 
use more meat. 
Oh, poor cows. 
Hey, Spatch. 
Hand me a Good Burger. 
Huh. 
They sound similar. 
Come on, 
what was our take today? 
That's it?! 
Oh... 
I suppose I can always feed 
my mother cat food. 
Now probably wouldn't 
be the best time 
to ask for a raise? 
No! 
I'm going home. 
Good night, people. 
Good night, 
Mr. Baily. 
So, Monique, what are you 
going to do tonight 
after you lock up? 
I thought I'd go home. 
Home? Why? 
Well, that's where my stuff is. Stuff. Ha, ha, ha. 
Hey, Dex. 
Want to hang out tonight? 
I don't know, but-- 
Hey Ed, you better be careful. You! 
Page 22/71
Me? 
Now I know 
where I saw you before. 
You're the roller-blading nut 
that caused my accident. 
Uh... no? 
You're the reason 
You're the reason 
my mom found out 
I was driving without a license. Man, you cost me a fortune. 
You wrecked my 
summer, man. 
You ruined my life. 
So, you don't want 
to hang out tonight? 
No. I don't want to 
hang out with you... 
ever. 
Do you think 
you can get me to a hospital? 
I think I broke my ass. 
Come on, Otis. 
Get out of the way. 
Oh, man. 
Ah, Mr. Reed. 
Hard at work as usual. 
I'm having my lunch. 
Well, I just got my car back 
from the body shop, 
and I got to admit, 
good as new. 
Here's the receipt. 
No! 
The estimate was only 
Well, that my young brother, 
is why they call it an estimate. Close to, kind of, could be. 
And I estimate 
it'll take you 
about two and half months 
to get me my money. 
Now, you have a good day 
at work. 
Page 23/71
I'm going to have lunch 
at Mondo Burger. 
Home of the Big Booty Burger. 
Home of the Big 
Booty Burger. 
Oh, man. 
Mind if I sit here? 
Yes, I do mind. 
Uh, thanks. 
What-what-what 
are you doing? 
Eating my lunch. 
I told you not 
to sit here. 
I don't like you. 
Can't you get that 
through your head? 
I can try. 
Hmm. 
Nope. 
All right, 
I see, I'm going 
to have to spell 
this out for you. 
I don't want to sit by you. 
I don't want to see you. 
I don't want to smell you. 
I don't want 
to hang out with you. 
I don't even want to use words with the letter \"U.\" 
Look, I'm Grape Nose Boy. 
Stop that. 
Would you stop? 
Uh, that ain't funny. 
All right. 
Page 24/71
Ha! Made you laugh. 
Ha. 
So... Oh, I give up. 
Grape? 
Uh, no, I'll pass. 
Now, I should 
have figured 
that lunch with you 
would be... different. 
Ah. Huh. 
Hey, what's that goo? 
Oh, that's my sauce. 
I make it myself. 
Huh. 
You carry your 
own sauce? 
Doesn't everybody? 
Hey, hey, would 
you watch it? 
Sorry. 
Hey, that is 
kind of good. 
You sure you made 
this by yourself? 
Yeah. It's my very own recipe. Nobody knows about this, right? Nope. 
Hey, Fizz, 
come here. 
Hi, you guys. 
What can I...? 
Hey, what did you do? 
Mmm. 
This is really good. 
What did you guys put on this? Deedee, Otis, 
Monique, come here. 
Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
Hey, hey! 
Mom, I got to call you back. 
This is 
so good. 
Hey, hey, hey. 
What in the name of 
Page 25/71
ground beef is going on? 
Mr. Baily, 
try this. 
Dexter, I don't have time... 
It's good. 
Terrific. 
Mm-hmm. 
This is marvelous. 
What is it? 
A French fry. 
I know that, Ed. 
I'm talking about the sauce. 
What's in the sauce? 
Ed's ingredients. 
He made it himself. 
Ed? 
Excellent. 
It's awesome. 
It makes me glad 
I'm not dead. 
Ed! 
If we put that sauce 
on all the Good Burgers, 
then everyone will 
want to eat here. 
We'll knock Mondo Burger 
right off the map. 
Whee! That's great. 
Yeah! 
It's true. 
Ed, get in that kitchen 
and start making sauce. 
Yippee skippy! 
It shall be done. 
Don't let us down. 
Get me another 
French fry. 
Good Burger's back in business. Yeah! 
Page 26/71
Ed... 
I've never seen 
so many customers. 
Good Burger's back 
in business. 
Oh, back in business. 
Move over, 
Mondo Burger. 
Move over. 
And Ed? 
What? 
For every Good 
Burger we sell, 
I'm going to give you ten cents for every one! Oh, man. 
A little help here. 
Oh, okay, 
be right there. 
No, no, no, no. 
I'll help Deedee. 
You get in that kitchen 
Page 27/71
and keep making sauce. 
Well, Ed, how's 
that sauce-making 
coming along? 
Oh, pretty good. 
Mr. Baily says 
it's going to save Good Burger. That's great. 
Now, you do remember 
that it was my idea 
to put the sauce on Good Burgers in the first place, right? 
Yeah, you should get some 
of the money I receive. 
I'm glad to hear you say that. In fact, since 
we're going to be 
in business together, 
I thought that maybe 
we should sign 
a little contract. 
Just to make our 
partnership official. 
Yeah, okay. 
Hmm. 
Mm-hmm. 
Mm... hmm. 
Oh, oh, yeah. 
Mmm, mmm. 
Mmm. 
I know some of these words. 
Ah. 
So, what does it all mean, 
Dexter? 
Well, it's-it's quite simple, 
really. 
Of all the money 
that Good Burger makes 
off your sauce, 
Cool? Okay. 
And then I'll 
keep the other 
for both of us. 
Okay. 
Page 28/71
There you go. 
Cool. All right. 
Ed? 
customers out there. 
It's unbelievable. 
What do you put 
in that sauce? 
Well, you start off 
with a little lemon juice 
and some ketchup. 
Um, look, Dexter, 
I like you as a friend and all, but it might... 
No. Listen to 
me carefully. 
Okay. 
Do not tell anyone the 
recipe to your sauce. 
Oh. Well, first you start off 
with a little lemon juice... 
Stop it! 
Stop talking. 
Oh. 
Never tell anyone 
the ingredients 
of your sauce. 
Why? 
You want to save Good 
Burger, don't you? 
Oh, yeah. 
Good Burger's my life. 
Well, then, you got to keep 
your sauce recipe a secret. 
All right? 
Okay. 
All right. 
Um, Dexter? 
Hmm? 
You're squishing my pancreas. 
Sorry. 
Thanks. 
Unbelievable. 
Two days ago, 
we had Good Burger crushed. 
Page 29/71
Now look at 'em. 
I think 
it's the sauce, boss. 
Oh. 
Duh. I know that. 
You think Kurt's stupid? 
Mmm... Uh-uh, uh-uh. 
I want Good Burger 
out of business. 
Go find out 
what's in that sauce. 
I'll go get some 
and have it checked out. 
Ed, here's your 
take for the day. 
Yay! 
Yay! 
Thanks for the 
sauce, kid. 
Mmm! 
Love ya! 
Well, here you go, Ed. 
Yeah, well, see you tomorrow. 
Uh, hey-hey, Dex, 
uh, what you doing? 
You want to hang 
out or something? 
Gee, I don't know. 
I got to go clean my room. 
I-I got to... 
Please? 
Sure. Let-Let's hang out. 
Cool! 
Want to see 
my secret place? 
That's not what I had in mind. Come on! 
All-All right... 
I get you. 
This is my place. 
This is where I 
come and think. 
Well, I think. 
That's funny, 
Page 30/71
'cause I never took you 
for much of a thinker. 
Oh, yeah, sure. 
I think about all 
kind of things: 
Good Burger... 
squirrels... 
cardboard boxes... 
things that 
are sticky... 
I'll bet 
you don't have one real problem. Um, I got six toes 
on my left foot. 
What kind of problems 
do you have? 
Other than the ones<i> 
you</i> cause? Lots. 
Most of them started 
when I was a little kid. 
That's when my dad left me 
and my mom. 
since then. 
I remember the last time 
I saw my Dad. 
I was seven years old, 
and for no reason at all, 
he bought me this yo-yo. 
It was so cool. 
I mean, it wasn't 
just an ordinary yo-yo. 
It had lights that lit up 
when you yo-yoed it. 
Red lights on one side, 
and blue lights on the other. 
And it made this funky, 
whistling noise, too. 
Wow. 
That sounds 
like quite a yo-yo. 
You-you still got it? 
No. 
After awhile, 
Page 31/71
it stopped lighting up. 
Then it quit making that funky whistling noise. 
Then I guess 
my mom just threw it away. 
You know... 
I don't even remember 
what my dad looks like. 
I don't remember 
what my dad looks like, either. But at least 
I get to see him every day. 
I give up. 
I'm going home. 
Oh, h-hey, Dex. 
Uh, thanks for hanging out 
with me. 
It's no problem. 
See you tomorrow, buddy. 
You-You mean it? 
Mean what? 
Well, I'm your buddy. 
You-You called me your buddy. 
Yeah, sure. 
I guess so. 
See you tomorrow. 
Dexter, you got 
a delivery. 
You are going 
to freak. 
Ooh! 
Hey, Monique, 
um, check it. 
I got a delivery 
to make. 
You want to ride 
with me? 
Oh, I want to go, 
I want to go. 
Oh, yeah. 
You can go, Ed. 
Yay! 
Oh, man. 
Ed. 
Page 32/71
Ed, man, you got to park 
the burger. Slow down. 
Watch it, Steve! 
Hey, hey! 
Oh, hey, man. 
Whoa! 
Come on, man, 
the locker room's this way. 
So, after scoring that amazing, last-minute, game-winning shot, 
and bringing your team 
all the way 
to the NBA Championship, 
how do you feel? 
I feel hungry. 
Delivery. 
Shaq...! 
Oh, oh, oh! 
Oh, oh, huh. 
Here's your 
Good Burger. Huh. 
Little man, 
I ordered tomatoes 
on this Good Burger. 
I don't see no tomatoes. 
Well, hang on. Uh. 
Huh! 
Consider yourself tomatoed. 
You're not like other people, 
are you? 
No. 
Um, go-go on 
ahead, Shaq. 
Take a bite 
of the Good Burger, 
and tell us how 
you like the good sauce. 
Tastes good, tastes good. 
You heard it 
here, folks. 
Shaquille O'Neal, 
a man who enjoys good food. 
Huh! Huh! 
Look, Dex, we're on live TV! 
Page 33/71
Oh, welcome to Good Burger, 
home of the Good Burger. 
Can I take your order? 
Huh. Whoa. 
I've never been on TV before. 
Whoa. Hey. 
I'm sick of these pukes. 
Shut up! 
You're not so fast 
with the trash talk now, 
are you, huh? 
You got him that time, bro. 
Yeah, but if you 
hadn't noticed, 
Good Burger is<i> 
still</i> in business. 
Well, what are we supposed 
to do about it? 
Our burgers are already twice 
the size of theirs. 
Kitchen. 
Y-yes, sir. 
Make our burgers bigger. 
Bigger? But they're already... Bigger! Bigger! 
Now, let's see Good Burger 
go against burgers three times the size of their own. 
Great. 
But what about 
the Ed Sauce? 
Welcome to Good Burger. 
Home of the Good Burger. 
Can I take your order? 
You all right, bro? 
Hey, hey, hey. 
Page 34/71
I know you. 
You're the dude 
from Mondo Burger. 
Correct-a-mundo. 
Kurt Bozwell. 
No, no, no. 
I'm Ed. 
Can I give you a lift, Ed? 
Oh, I don't know, dude. 
Just get in the car, huh? 
Oh, car? 
Yeah. 
Uh-oh. 
Uh-oh. Uh...! 
Ed, I'm going to cut 
right to the chase. 
You have been working 
at Good Burger now 
for like, what, 
three years? 
And your manager 
still only pays you 
five bucks an hour, man. 
Really? Cool! 
Huh. 
Well, five bucks 
an hour's cool... 
How does... ten bucks sound? 
Ten bucks. 
I don't know. 
It sounds sort of like... 
I want you to bail 
on Good Burger, and I want you to come and work for me 
at Mondo Burger. 
You make your sauce for Kurt. 
Who's Kurt? 
I'm Kurt. 
I'm Ed. 
I'm aware! 
You said you were Kurt. 
Well, uh, thanks 
for the ride. 
Whenever you're ready 
Page 35/71
to come and work for me, 
you say the word. 
Okay. 
Mm. 
What were you doing 
in Kurt's car? 
Oh, you know, just pushing 
buttons and hanging out. Huh. 
What'd he say 
to you? 
Something about working 
at Mondo Burger. 
I think he likes me. 
Ed! That diphthong 
doesn't like you! 
He just wants 
to use you. 
Oh, well, that's not... 
\"natural.\" 
No. 
He wants your sauce. 
Look, don't tell him 
the sauce recipe, all right? 
Because if you do, Good Burger's going to be in big trouble. 
Okay. 
All right. 
Cool. 
Now, let's 
get to work. 
All right. 
Um, Dex... 
Um, I got you something. 
Here. 
What, what is this? 
It's a yo-yo. 
I bought it 
It lights up and 
flickers and everything. 
Just like the one 
your dad gave you. 
Why'd you get this for me? 
'Cause we're buds. Huh. 
Huh. Yeah. 
Page 36/71
Huh. Huh. 
What's with this dude? 
He doesn't want to work 
at Mondo Burger. 
If you ask me, 
the guy's a few tacos short 
of a combination plate. 
I don't care. 
Now, Kurt's going to get 
his sauce. 
I didn't come this far to let 
some tired crap shack like 
Good Burger get in my way. 
Bring in Roxanne. 
If anyone can get the sauce 
out of Ed... <i>she</i> can. 
Excuse me. 
Hello? 
Um, welcome to Good Burger, 
home of the Good Burger. 
Can I take your order? Huh. 
No, thanks. 
I just came here 
to see you, Ed. 
I'm Roxanne. 
Oh! 
Welcome to Good Burger, 
home of the Good Burger. 
Can I take your order? Huh. 
Page 37/71
You are so hot. 
Oh, well, I often sweat 
at work. Huh. 
So, you hungry? 
Yes, I am hungry... 
but not for food. 
I'm hungry for you. 
Oh, well... 
well, I'm not edible. 
Huh... Huh. 
How would you like 
to go on date tomorrow night? 
With who? 
Me, silly. 
Huh. Me silly, too. 
No. 
I meant that you 
and I should go out together 
tomorrow night. 
Want to? 
Oh, okay. Cool. Huh. 
Awesome. 
Here's my address. 
I don't believe 
what I just saw. 
Who? Elvis? 
No, a beautiful girl 
just strode in here 
and asked you on a date. 
Oh, I know. 
Hey, want to come? 
Oh, no. Three's 
a crowd, man. 
Oh, well, 
just bring a date. 
Hey, why don't 
you ask Monique. 
I... I don't think so. 
Now, you know you 
like her-- huh. 
How can I not like her? 
I mean, she's smart, 
funny, beautiful... 
and cuddly. 
Page 38/71
Oh, then just ask her out. 
No. 
Aw, what, you chicken? 
I'm not a chicken. 
Are too. 
Dexter's a chicken! 
Chicken! Moo! 
Moo! 
I'm not a chicken. 
It's just that I don't think 
she wants to waste her time 
going out with me, that's all. Moo! 
Chickens...! 
Chickens don't moo, man. 
They cluck. 
Hey, Monique, 
we're all going out 
tomorrow night. 
You want to be Dexter's date? 
Look, man, 
I told you... 
I'd love to. 
I, I knew she'd say yes. 
Moo! 
Yeah, corn dogs! 
Your chair, Madame. 
Why, thank you, Dexter. 
Your chair. Huh! 
Um, is your butt okay? 
It's fine. Thank you. 
It's okay, people! 
Her butt is fine! 
Huh. 
Mmm! That's a great corn dog. 
Mm-hmm. 
I wonder how they 
Page 39/71
get the weenie 
into the corny 
exterior? Yeah. 
A question that's plagued 
mankind for centuries. 
You know what'd go great 
on these corn dogs? 
Um... a turtleneck? 
No, silly. 
Some of your sauce. 
I just love your sauce. 
How do you make it? 
I'm dying to know. 
Well, first you 
start off with some 
ketchup and some 
lemon juice... 
Ow! 
Oops. 
Oh, what's the matter? 
Is it your butt? 
No. 
Uh, oh. 
Um... 
Wha-What do you say 
we start putting? 
Ooh. I get to go first. 
All right. Word. 
Come on, Roxanne. 
Ed... can't we just go 
somewhere and be alone? 
What for? 
Well, maybe we could talk. 
Or maybe get to know 
each other a little better. 
Now doesn't that 
sound like more fun 
than miniature golf? 
No! 
Come on. 
Oh... 
Page 40/71
So close yet so far. 
My turn. Excuse me. 
Thank you very much. 
All righty. 
Oh... 
Huh. 
Okay, yeah. 
All right. 
You're all right. 
Oh, oh... 
Mm-mm. 
So, uh, is this 
your first time? 
Uh-huh, keep talking. 
Mm-hmm. 
Huh. Okay, my turn. 
Huh, huh. 
Huh... 
Fore! 
Your turn. 
Then when I was six, 
I said my first words. 
My mom thinks it was 
\"trousers,\" 
but I think it 
was \"tweezers.\" 
And then I went to camp 
and fell down a sand dune... 
Ed... Ed! 
She's still 
unconscious, bro. 
Oh... 
What happened? 
Your head hit my golf ball. 
Then you went sleepy-bye. 
Um... Monique, 
you want to take a walk? 
Sure. 
Page 41/71
Wait, wait, wait. 
What am I supposed to do? 
Hello! 
Hello. 
What am I 
supposed to do? 
Ed... I think Roxanne can, uh, help you figure something out. So, Ed... 
what do you want to do? 
Well, I always wanted 
to shave a Martian. 
Got a Martian. Huh! 
Here you go. 
Thank you. 
So, uh, you like me? 
Of course. 
So, uh... you like me? 
Are you kidding? 
I liked you from the 
first time I saw you-- 
right off the bat. 
But I guess it was the 
same for you, too, huh? 
No, actually, I thought you were self-centered and obnoxious. 
Well, so much for 
my self-esteem. 
I changed my mind, 
didn't I? 
Yes, you did. How come? 
Ed. 
Excuse me. 
Ed thinks you're 
a really great guy. 
He's always talking about 
what a good friend 
you are to him... 
and what a nice and caring 
person you are. 
Really? 
Ed said all that? 
Mm-hmm. 
Ed is the sweetest, 
Page 42/71
most genuine person 
I've ever met. 
And, uh, anybody 
he likes that much... 
can't be all bad. 
Look at me, Ed. 
I'm looking. 
What do you see? 
That big red lump 
on your forehead 
where the golf ball hit you. 
Huh! 
Look into my eyes, Ed. 
Ed? 
Tell me how you make 
your sauce... 
and I'll give you 
anything you want. 
Uh, whatcha got? 
For starters... 
how about this. 
Oh, no! 
Ooh! 
Sorry. 
You surprised me. 
Can-can you breathe? 
I quit! 
I'm guessing she didn't get 
the sauce recipe. 
I'm aware. 
Hello. My name is 
Connie Mondune. 
I'm hosting a family reunion, 
and my oven has run amok! 
Huh. 
I think it's 
the heat actuator. 
Anywho, I'd like to order, uh 
three Good Meals, 
Page 43/71
four Junior Good Meals, 
of your Good Chunks. 
Um, okay, on two 
of the Junior Good Meals, 
I need to substitute 
the Good Cookies for Good Pies. Now don't fret 
if that's extra. 
I'll pony up the overage. 
And, uh, oh, 
on the Regular Good Meals, 
I need two of the Good Burgers to have ketchup, mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, but no onion. I've got an interview 
this afternoon. 
Let's see, that takes care 
of everyone but Uncle Leslie, 
who doesn't eat meat, but, of course, he does eat dairy, so I don't get it. Let's get Leslie a Good Chick with some Good Fries and a Good Root Beer. All to go. But I would like to have my beverage while I wait. Now, total me up! 
Guess who. 
Hi, Dexter. 
Hey. What you doing? 
Getting ready for work. 
Oh, cool, cool. 
Um, listen, since we had 
such a nice time last night, 
uh, I thought that maybe 
we could do it again tonight. 
I don't think so. 
Okay. Tomorrow night, then? 
No. 
Well, maybe this weekend? 
Maybe not. 
Okay. 
Who are you and what have done with the real Monique? 
Oh, she's right here. 
It's just that now, 
Page 44/71
she knows the real Dexter. 
Come again? 
You forgot your jacket 
last night. 
Oh. Thank you. 
And this fell 
out of the pocket. 
Oh, um... this? 
This is just, 
all it is... 
All-All it is... 
Right, it's just the 
contract you had Ed sign. 
You know, the one where, uh, 
you take most of his money. 
The money he's supposed 
to get for his sauce. 
No... yeah. 
But, look, 
I was just trying... 
You know, 
I can't believe 
that you would do 
something like that 
to someone who trusts you. 
How can you take advantage 
of a sweet person like Ed?! 
And after 
he got you a job?! 
It ain't even like that. 
I only wanted... 
Oh, I know what you wanted. 
You're not Ed's friend. 
You're just using him 
to scam a little 
cash on the side. 
It must feel really good. 
Babe... 
Oh, but don't worry. 
I'm not going to tell Ed 
that you're cheating him. 
Why not? 
Because it would hurt him 
too much. 
Page 45/71
Punk. 
Mmm! 
There you are, Ed. 
Um, can I sit here? 
On my lap? 
No, man. 
I'll just sit down 
right next to you. 
All right, look, Ed, 
I don't know 
how to say this. 
Oh, you just go: 
\"This.\" 
No, um, I-I'm talking 
about this contract. 
What is it, boy? 
Oh, wha...? What? 
Four clowns?! 
Their car's broken down? 
They're in trouble? 
Man, that dog is 
not talking to you. 
W-w-wait, hang on. 
He's trying to tell us 
that there's four clowns 
stuck somewhere 
and their car broke down. 
Where, boy, where? 
Ed, there 
are no clowns. 
Man, that dog 
is just hungry. 
Oh, well, maybe 
we should feed him. 
Here, have 
a Mondo Burger. 
Huh. 
He's not 
eating it. 
Well, what's wrong? 
I don't know. 
He definitely looks hungry, 
though. 
Page 46/71
Yeah. 
Well, here. 
Try a Good Burger. 
Would you 
look at that? 
See, I told you 
there was something wrong 
with Mondo Burger. 
He knows it, 
don't you, boy? 
He definitely 
senses something 
that he doesn't like. 
What do you think 
it could be? 
I don't know. 
Let's find out. 
Where is that dang dog? 
Excuse me, ladies, 
may I help you? 
Could you kindly point us 
in the direction 
of the little girls' room? 
Yes, ma'am. 
The ladies room 
is just on the other side 
of the restaurant. 
I'll show you. 
Oh, get your hands 
Ma'am! 
Off of me! 
I'm mighty mad... 
Ma'am, I'm just trying to help. I don't need your... oh! 
Oh! Oh! 
Water! Water! 
I need water! 
Whoo! Water! Oh! 
Water! Ooh! 
Water! Oh! Water! Oh! 
Okay, I'll be right back. 
Water! 
Water, water, water! 
Whoo! Oh, oh. 
Page 47/71
All right, let's go. 
Hey, what about 
your water? 
Would you just come on?! 
H-hey, what's that stuff 
they're dropping 
in the burgers? 
I don't know, 
but I bet 
that's what's making 
those burgers grow so big. 
We should get some of 
that stuff for Good Burger. 
No, man, stuff like 
that's got to be illegal. 
It is illegal. 
Whoo! Oh...! 
Triambythal 
is <i>way</i> illegal. 
But I tell you what. 
It sure makes burgers 
nice and \"enormo.\" 
Oh, yeah, that's all 
well and good, but 
what happens 
to all those 
nice, innocent people 
when they eat your 
\"enormo\" burgers? 
Uh-oh. 
Don't care, ladies. 
Ooh! Uh... 
Yeah, yeah, laugh it up. 
Uh-huh. 
But when those people find out that you're putting 
illegal stuff in their meat 
you're going to find 
yourself in jail. 
That is why 
nobody outside this kitchen 
is going to find out. 
What do you expect us to do, 
keep our mouths shut? 
Page 48/71
No. I'll keep your mouths shut. Ed, run! 
Okay, hot pants, 
now, I'm tired 
of playing games. 
I want to know 
what's in your sauce. 
Well, you can forget it. 
You're not going 
to get Ed's sauce. 
I want to know 
what's in your sauce. 
Dude, you need a Tic Tac. 
Ha-ha! 
That coils it. 
You guys are grass. 
What are we going 
to do with them? 
Get our pal Wade on the phone. Demented Hills? 
Hmm. 
Hey, all right, 
yeah, hey, easy, man, easy. 
Yeah, all right, 
uh-huh, see, you'd like to... 
You'll never be 
half the man your mama was. 
Hey, man, 
you better let me go! 
Hey, man, open the door! 
I'm not going to tell you again! All right, maybe I'll tell you one more time. 
Open this door, please?! Oh...! Look, Dex, the 
walls are padded! 
Look what I can do! 
I don't get it. 
I-I just don't get it. 
Where could they be? 
I'm really worried, 
you guys. 
Page 49/71
Hi. 
Uh, huh... hi. 
I'm a psychopath. 
I'm Ed. 
Have small space aliens 
ever landed in your brain 
and told you 
to break into the zoo 
and free 
the kangaroos? 
Not that I recall. 
Do you think I'm cute? 
Sure. Huh. 
What's cute about me? 
Um... your head. 
You have a cute head, too. 
Well, I try to keep it nice. 
So, what you in for? 
I got in trouble 
for breaking into the zoo 
and freeing all the kangaroos. Oh. 
My name is Heather. 
Really? My mom's 
name is Heather. 
Really? 
No. 
I like you, Ed. 
Oh. 
Uh... go fish. 
Would you stop 
eating the cards? 
And quit poking me. 
Are you crazy? 
Man...! 
I got to play cards 
with these folk?! 
Would you quit it?! 
You're nasty! 
Ah, hey, dude. 
Hey, they gave me a jacket 
Page 50/71
just like that. 
Need some help? 
Huh! Okay. 
He's loose! 
Look out! 
Oh! Goodness gracious, 
he's killing Sidney! 
Open it. 
There's the fridge. 
Go get the 
sauce, dudes. 
Got it. 
What's going on 
in here? 
Stop waving 
that dang light in my face. 
Who are you? 
Your mama. 
Who are you? 
Relax. 
It's the old guy 
that works here. 
Well, what are you doing here 
this late? 
Sleeping, 
till you woke my butt up. 
What's that junk 
you're pouring into our sauce? Shut up, old man. 
Don't be rude 
to the elderly. 
The old man asked 
us a question. 
Now, it's called 
shark poison, 
and it's going 
to make all 
your little Good Burger 
customers very, very sick. 
So sick that 
I doubt anybody 
will ever want to 
eat here again. 
I'm calling the cops. 
Page 51/71

You're not 
calling anyone. 
In you go. 
Join your buddies. 
Otis? 
Otis, you came to visit, huh? 
Oh, I'm fine, and you? 
Help me get him 
out of this! 
Do I look like 
I came to visit?! 
Where am I? 
What's going on? 
They kidnapped us. 
Why'd they bring 
you here? 
'Cause I caught those 
little Mondo brats 
dumping shark 
poison in our sauce. 
Shark poison?! 
Wow, why do they want to harm 
those innocent sharks? 
Will you forget 
about the sharks? 
That stuff's going 
to harm innocent people. 
Can you get 
to a phone? 
There's no chance. 
We got to get out 
of this place. 
What time is it? 
I'll tell you. 
That means we only got 
four hours to warn them. 
But how are we going 
to get out of here? 
You just let me handle 
that part. 
Good morning, patients. 
It's medication time. 
I'll be back in ten minutes 
with your various prescriptions. Page 52/71

Ooh, that music sucks. 
Yeah, it does. 
Well, hang on. Huh. 
Hey, dude, 
I'll be right back. 
Where you going? 
Ed? Ed? 
Um, Ed? 
Hey, I don't think 
you should be touching 
the knob on the... 
...on the radio dial. 
Heh, heh. 
Um... 
Huh, huh, huh, huh-huh... 
Come on, 
dance with me. 
Come on, huh. 
Feel it? 
Come on, 
everybody. 
Yeah, let's have some fun! Yeah! Get on up! Yeah! 
Yeah, cool! 
Hey, check 
out the kooks. 
Aren't they something? 
Page 53/71
How y'all doing? 
I bet y'all got some moves, huh? No, I-I really 
couldn't do that. 
Yeah, I'm not 
very good at that. 
Oh, come on, now. 
You know you... 
It's against 
regulations. 
See? Bobbin' your head. 
Hey, ho, hey, ho... 
Come on, y'all, let's party. 
Page 54/71
Go, go, go, out! 
Oh... 
Easy. 
In here. 
Phew! 
I think I picked 
a bad room. 
Just don't make 
any sudden moves. 
What's up, dude? 
Huh! Give me five! 
On the black-hand side-- 
Huh, yeah! Hey, cool! 
Leave it to you 
to make friends 
with a vicious 
psychopath. 
Attention! Seal all exit doors. There is an escape attempt 
in progress. 
Seal all exit doors. 
Can we open 
any of these windows? 
Uh-uh, you can't-- 
they're hermetically sealed, 
made of triple-thick, 
bulletproof glass. 
Mister huge scary man, 
can you help me open 
one of these windows? 
Cool. Go ahead, 
man, do your thing. 
Page 55/71
Hey, man, what you think 
you doing? 
Oh, mercy, now... 
Try to open the window! 
Oh, man! 
Thank you! 
Hey! Try this one! 
They're coming. 
You two better hurry. 
You don't got to tell me twice. Whoa. 
Ed... hurry! 
All right, 
but before I go, 
I just want to tell you, 
you're the nicest, prettiest 
psychopath I've ever met. 
Oh, you're so sweet. 
Get off of me! 
Would you... 
get up? 
All right. 
That way. 
Come on. 
I'll check my phone! 
This way! This way! 
Harry, you go that way! 
Okay! Follow me, Steve. 
All right, come on this way. 
Oh, oh... 
Here's one for you, 
and a vanilla pop for you, 
and an ice cream sandwich, 
and a chocolate pop... 
Hey, what are you doing?! 
Stealing your truck. 
Yeah, we'll 
bring it back. 
Come on! 
Huh. 
Oh, ice cream tune! 
Will you turn that off? 
Ice cream man! 
Page 56/71
Oh, sorry. No ice cream 
for you today. 
Got to go. Got to get back 
to Good Burger. 
Oh, oh... 
Good Burger's about to open, 
man. 
We got to get there 
and make sure nobody eats 
that poison sauce. 
Man, they're gaining on us! 
Whoa, 
ice cream cones! Look! 
I got funky pops, 
monster-cicles, 
and lemon juice pops! Huh! 
Ed, this is no time 
for frozen treats, all right? 
Yeah, but... 
Wait. Wait. Give me one. 
Oh, here you go. 
Thanks. 
What was that? 
I think it's a fudgesicle. 
Give me some more. 
Get out of here! 
Yeah! 
Have some vanilla! 
Take that! Huh! 
And a little bit of that! Huh! Have some raspberry sorbet! 
How do you like me now? 
I'm a dude throwing ice cream! French vanilla! Yeah! 
Take some chocolate! 
Yeah! Fudge! 
Oh! Yeah, there you go, baby! 
Oh... 
Yeah, they're going to have you on <i>This Old Homey.</i> 
Nice box, Wheat. 
Yeah? 
I can't see. 
I can't see! 
Page 57/71
No! No! 
Watch it, fellas! Stop! 
Whew! 
Look out! 
Look out! 
Oh, no! Come on! 
Whoo! Lost 'em. 
Hi. Welcome 
to Good Burger, 
home of the Good Burger. 
Can I take your order? 
I'll have a Good Burger... 
with extra sauce. 
Oh! That sounds delightful. 
I'll have the same thing. 
Better step on it. 
Whoa! 
Two 
Good Burgers, extra sauce. 
Thank you. 
Oh, poo. I wanted mustard. 
Ed, hurry! 
Don't let anyone eat 
a Good Burger. 
Come on, Otis. 
No! 
Get him off me. 
What's going on? 
What the...? 
Ed! Ed! Ed! 
What are you doing? 
Ed, get off! 
Ed, off the elderly. 
Ed! 
Ed, Ed, are you okay? 
What happened? 
I just tackled 
some old lady. 
Cool. 
All right, Ed! 
Way to go. 
Excuse me, would one of you two mind telling me 
why this is a good thing? 
Page 58/71
This is why-- Mondo Burger 
poisoned our sauce. 
How could Mondo Burger 
poison our sauce? 
We'll explain it to you later. Right now, just keep everyone 
from eating that sauce, 
and call the cops. 
Come on, Ed. 
Where are we going? 
To get a can 
of triambythal. 
What for? 
Proof. 
Okay. 
I need a hot Jacuzzi. 
Shall I ring? 
No! 
Man, you can't just walk 
up there and ring the bell 
and say \"Howdy do, neighbor.\" We got to find a way to sneak 
into the kitchen somehow. 
I got an idea. Huh. 
Follow me. 
Where are you doing? 
Oh, dear, careful. 
Maybe you should... 
I don't know if... 
Whoo! Shouldn't you have 
a harness or some rope? 
Come on, it's easy! 
Yeah, easy for you! 
Dang! 
Climb on a truck?! 
I don't even know the person 
that owns this truck. 
And I got 
to do my thing... 
Yeah. 
Now... all right,

I... I'm... I'm... 
Page 59/71
Whoo! 
See? 
Oh! 
All right. 
You got it. 
Got what? 
I'm swinging from a dang pipe. Mama? 
Whew! 
Ed... 
Ed. 
Ed! 
Over here! 
Over here. Come on! 
What are you doing 
in the straw? 
It's right over the kitchen. 
I can see it! 
Come on! 
How do expect me 
to get up there? 
Oh, it's easy. 
You just jump on the burger, 
jump on the fry, 
and then you hop on the cup, 
and then shimmy up the straw. 
What is this,<i> 
American Gladiators?</i> 
Come on! 
All right. 
Can't believe this man 
got me... 
climbing on a straw! 
Ooh! Wow, Good Burger looks 
so small from up here. 
Ed? Ed, Ed, are you in there? 
Here, take my hand. 
Ed? Ed?! 
Whee! 
Again! Again! 
That was cool! 
Shh! Listen, listen. 
I'm gonna go into that kitchen. Then I want you to count to ten, 
Page 60/71
and come in there and get a can of that chemical 
and hightail it back 
to Good Burger, all right? 
All right, okay. 
All right. 
One... 
two... three... 
Hey, everybody! 
What's happening? 
How'd you get here? 
Ooh! Look at this fancy kitchen. You know, Mama never had 
one of these 
with the electronic numbers. 
We always 
had to turn the knobs... 
Let's get him! 
...wait for the little ding... 
If I were you... 
I wouldn't come <i>any</i> closer. Get him. 
Get him! 
Come on, guys. 
Let's go! Let's go! 
Ooh! 
Mm-mm. 
Go! Around 
the other way! 
All right, punk... 
the game is over. 
Yeah. Your game is over, 
because right now, 
my man Ed 
is on his way down 
to the police station 
with a can 
of your illegal triambythal. 
Ha! 
Hey, Dex, got it! Huh. 
Get it! 
Give me that. 
Page 61/71
Oh! 
Nice try, dudes, 
but you mess with Kurt, 
and you go in the grinder. 
Here you go, boss. 
Thanks, Holmes. 
This can's empty. 
What an idiot. 
Stole an empty can. 
Ed, you stole a empty can?! 
It wasn't empty when 
I found it. Huh. 
Oh... 
Hey! 
What's going on? 
I don't know. 
The kitchen! Go! 
Come on! 
Come on. 
Come on, Ed, let's go! 
Grill! We got to 
stop the grill! 
Oh... 
Let's get out of here! 
Must be a shift change. 
Huh? 
Why? 
Why? 
What have I done? 
What, 
are you going to put cuffs on me, huh? Wha...? 
Relax, sir, it's 
going to be okay. 
You tell me if these 
are too tight, all right? 
You don't understand! 
But none of this 
is my fault, okay? 
I mean... 
I don't know. 
Hey, let's go 
help him out. Huh. 
Let's. 
Page 62/71
Listen, 
I can explain everything. 
This is all just a 
big misunderstanding. 
I don't understand. 
I don't know what happened. 
Oh, sure you do. 
Why don't you go on ahead 
and tell 
your little police friend 
that you made 
your big Beefy Burgers 
all big and beefy 
by using illegal 
food additives. 
Is that true? 
No! He's lying! 
You're lying! 
You're full 
of crap! 
Yeah? Well, why don't 
we just check these out, 
and we'll see who's lying. 
I think you better 
come with us. 
Man, you're out 
of your minds. 
You're crazy, man! 
You know who I am? Huh? 
Yeah, I know, 
I know. 
Bye-bye. 
Hey, hey, 
remember: 
when you mess 
with Good Burger... 
you go in the grinder! 
Oh, dog, 
you enjoy prison now. 
Page 63/71
Excuse me for a second. 
Huh. 
Mr. Wheat, 
I can't, I can't... 
I can fix it. 
I can fix it. 
...have a couple 
words for... 
I can fix it. 
I can fix it. Uh! 
Uh, Mr. Wheat? 
I don't have 
a lot of time, 
but I do got a 
couple words for you. 
Look here. 
Here's about half 
of the money 
that I owe you 
for your car, 
and I guess I'll 
have the other half 
by the end of the summer. 
You enjoy your car! 
Bye-bye, now. 
I'll give you some money. 
Help me out! 
Man, just help me 
get the burger off. 
Ooh-hoo, come on, Ed. 
Huh. 
So, <i>you</i> poured that stuff in that meat, didn't you? 
Huh, I had to. 
You <i>had</i> to? 
Sure. See, I knew 
if I took the can, 
Page 64/71
there was a good chance 
I'd get caught. Huh. 
Then I thought, 
even if I did take 
the triambythal to 
the proper authorities, 
huh, Kurt would hire some 
high-powered attorneys 
who would dispute 
any charges 
brought against him 
or Mondo Burger, 
by manipulating 
the legal system. 
And the way that 
America's court system 
is congested these days, 
it would have taken months 
to convict him of anything. 
So then I thought, 
I'll take matters 
into my own hands 
and just pour 
the triambythal 
into the meat supply 
and let Mondo Burger 
be a victim of 
its own foul play. 
Ha! Huh! 
Oh, wait-wait 
wait-wait. 
You thought of all that? 
Yeah, sure. 
I'm not stupid. Huh. 
Huh. 
Well, look, Ed, 
about this contract, man, 
what do you say we just... 
forget it? 
Wait, y-you don't 
want to be partners? 
Well, no. 
See... 
Is it because I'm black? 
Page 65/71
No, it's not because 
you're... 
'cause <i>I'm...</i> 
All right, look, forget it. 
All right, 
we can be partners, 
but the money is yours, 
all right? 
All of it. 
So, we're still buddies? 
Oh, you know it. 
Cool. Huh. 
Um, Dexter? 
Huh? 
I-I just want to 
say that, well, 
I'm really going 
to miss you... 
a lot. 
And, um... I will 
always remember you, 
Dexter Reed, 
in my thoughts 
and in my heart. 
Good-bye, my friend! 
Uh, Ed? 
Um, Ed? 
I'm not going anywhere, man. 
Oh. 
That's right, baby, yeah! 
Here come the heroes! 
Let's hear it for the man 
who saved Good 
Burger, huh? Yeah! 
Go, Ed! 
Oh! 
Ed, Ed, Ed, Ed... 
What? What? What? What? What? 
Come on, what? Come on. 
Come on. 
Aw... aw! 
Speech, speech... 
Yeah, speech! 
Page 66/71
Yeah, come on, Ed, 
say something. 
Well, I guess there's 
only way thing left <i>to</i> say: Huh. 
: Welcome to Good Burger, 
home of the Good Burger.

I worry about the moisture level of the plastic pussy. 
Although you can on lubricants such as Astroglide recourse, on lubricants other manufacturers, 
nevertheless, I think that you may

Ok, gentlemen. 
Let's discuss the more it with rector Burns. 
- Hi.

I was just in the area and want to talk to you about Jesus. Have you ever thought to let the Lord in your heart? 
Yes, I know that the personal data, because it is my data. UTAH!

So it feels now already. 
What is the Vagina? 
Hello, welcome to the Electric Beach. Tanning complacent? For him, yes. 
I stay on the right side, you stay on the left. 
Oh God, I love this book. 
There are so many good stories in it. That it is essential to have read. The Bible is God's cookbook. 
In it he gives the recipes for life. 
What recipes? 
For example, I cook for no man before he infects me a ring. Brother, do not pull me by the hair. 
- Even when beating rules. - Yes. 
- Where is the bot? - No idea what you're talking. 
Not the answer I want to hear. 
- Have not you wondered exactly? - Listen carefully. 
Between the hardware and software put $ 300,000 of us.

Oh shit. 
We need times seriously entertained. 
OK. Let's talk about making out.

Hey, the. 
So, what's up? 
What do you want? She was in my house when I arrived. Tell me everything you've told her Shaqobi. 
- You I say nothing. - You're welcome. 
Sex is sacred. 
Ok, well, actually, should be fun sex. 
When we first met, you said the same: 
"Oh, let's have sex immediately." 
And we all agreed. 
- Let's stay here please. - Fornication, none of the games of life. Fornication is the only game in life, baby. 
So we put the times and to the side. 
- And that definitely ... - fornication ... 
And definitely there also. 
You stay here, because the same we will repair you. Shaqobi, Bitte. 
That's fucking awesome, 
because the bigot in there talking about Jesus 
and says she played the last three hours the church! You have what I love, infected with a virus! 
Tell me right now what you said to Bardot, 
otherwise I cut on you, let bleed you, throw you in the blender and I rinse the toilet down, so you can swim with the fish, ok? I mean serious. 
No! 
- What? No! That was no answer. - Run, Shaqobi! 
That was not the answer! 
- Do not hide again in the dryer! - I'll eat you alive! - Crap! - I can reprogram. 
- I do it. - I advise you also. 
Otherwise I program my rights in your face! 
Do not let me just stand so! 
Do you believe in holy matrimony? 
I forgot how to breathe. 
Why do you have to watch Nard if I ask you this? 
I try to find out where this question comes. 
Do not you like what you see? 
Page 16/33
But. I like it. 
If you like it, you should have infected me a ring. I have to go. 
You know, the thing is, the girl in Deep Throat

Yes. We need all the information about a Limus Huffington. Everything. 
You should you really buy a diamond ring. 
It is impossible, they confirmed yet only. 
Kriegt them a ring, she thinks sex would have to ok. After all that's will probably never be ok to have sex with her. Can I get a pretzel? 
Two pretzels.

The ... Yes, the two Blue since. 
Ach Mist. Was...?

Rodney plays with Bardot. 
Are you her babysitter? Is that it? 
If they are good, then you fuck them or ...? 
But the body is not fornication, 
but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.

They want you. 
Me? How so? 
What do you want from me? 
Do you want me as the same reasons as those men? 
No. 
- This is something completely different. - How so? 
Because I have made you happy. 
It is safer if you stay here overnight. 
Benny remains with you. 
And where are you going? 
I have to eat with my family for dinner.

I understand something about repairing toys. 
But nothing of friendship! 
I'm going to ask you some questions. 
Just relax and answer as simple as you can. 
Mind if I smoke? 
It does not affect the test. 
A good Senator must be an insider and an outsider, and I am both. 
A good senator needs to know when he cry and when to laugh, and I know that. 
That's bullshit. 
Caroline, you will rewrite this shit before my appearance, ok? We will... 
Hey! There they are. Look at me, who comes there. All right. The Limited in Black. Says nothing. 
Three days. 
Can you then do not do anything right? FBI?

Young lady, when I hear ever tell you that you are late - And your monthly thing ... - Hey, hey, hey! No children before you. 39 Roger that? 
- Ok.

- All right. OK. - Only an education, then a job. Then you can have a baby. 
Until then, I want to hear a word of too late. Love engaged married. 
Only then comes the baby. Do you understand me? I think that was now a transfer. 
I believe. 
- I would like to pray. - OK. 
Come. 
Give Mom's hand. 
- No, I do not do. - Take Mamas hand. 
I do not like this rebellion. Not at all. 
- I ... - No more excuses more. 
Son, I'm dead serious. 
I do not understand where that comes from. 
Facebook. 
- This is the Internet. - This is the Internet. And your PORNOS. Do not think we do not know. But I do not like this lady in hotpants. 
Normally she wears no pants. 
That's it! That does not happen again. Come here. Stop it. 
All right, kid. Senator Biter. How are you?

I wanted to tell you a bedtime story, but only one word ... ... To the hard sock. 
How often have you ... In there hosed? 
The not mine. 
Do not do that. Clear is yours. We both know. Do you know what has pained me your age? 
Wash or throw away? What do you do? 
Depends on... 
... If I can find a new one. 
I only use single socks. 
Now you will laugh the same. 
I have done exactly the same thing. In earnest. I swear to god. Well, how do you think? 
You and I, we ... 
... Shoot our load in orphaned socks. 
Page 21/33
As I think of myself at your age. 
This brings back memories. 
Every day tens of erections. I was ugly, all you like. Oh yes. Come on. 
I always knew that no woman ever ... could satisfy my needs. What I have done to ... 
I put my wiener in a melon. 
That you determined not know. But it is absolutely true. They are placed half an hour into the tube. The melon, not my cock. Half an hour, and while at 120 degrees. 
At 180 you cook it. But that is not served. 
Half an hour at 120 degrees. Then you cut in there your hole and put off. 
Tell you what, Limus ... 
every time I boarded this melon, 
I wondered how well feels a warm vagina. 
I still wonder. 
Oh yeah. 
Bring back Bardot. 
No, no, I want you back bring Bardot, Limus, ok? 
I know you're doing that for me, 
because our conversation went better than I thought. We are cut from the same wood. I want you to bring them back. Good? That's the end of the bedtime story. 
So you have nothing to worry about. 
Bring it tomorrow morning back, ok? In order. 
Come on, lie down, sleep now. 
I spread yourself to yet. 
So. And now go to sleep. 
That has never been my dad. 
That he did constantly. 
Bring her back. Well, how about that? 
What about that? 
You bring them back. Well, how about that? 
You bring them back. 
Then it's good for all. 
- What should we do? - Lightning fast cunning are. 
If until then here and keep your eyes open.

Then she kills him. 
No, wait. 
No. 
I want to kill him. Bring him to me. 
Make no nonsense, you two. 
Page 22/33
I wanted to fix it, 
the only problem is, they do not know that it is a robot. - What is, she does not know? - You know, Benny. Stop it. I tell you, they do not know. Maybe she knew it, no idea. Maybe she is a replicant. 
As in Blade Runner. Yes. And died. 
- What? - Yes. 
- She is perfect. - You can you not say that. 
- No one will tell her that. - OK. Take it easy. I do not think that we tell her. I think we need to do ... Come down again. 
That it certainly says no. 
Oh shit. 
I really wish we could make ourselves invisible. Yes. Room 15, please. 
Out there must be 40 people, damn. 
Hey, my kung fu style is only enough for a dozen guys at once. We have no chance. 
- Then we'll die here together. - You would die for me? Huffy, honest, I admire your Bonnie and Clyde attitude, but it sounds totally stupid, if you say what that. I am bold and she is beautiful. And they will not get them. Yes, hi, guys. So, we know that you are in there. So do come out with your hands, ok? 
"With raised hands"? 
Original. 
- We do not give you! - OK. All right. 
Relax yourself. 
Hey, motherfucker, I'll tell you how it's run. 
He wants to talk to you. 
He wants to order something. 
Hello? 
Three large ice cream cones or three cans of coke ... - Do you want a pizza? - What the...? 
And a giant pizza. An extra large pizza. 
- What? - This is now a hostage! 
- We make demands, they deliver! - So you called Ice in waffle? - And. - And. 
- For real? - That's a cheap last meal. 
Also true again. 
If they bring us the ice, we do not give them out anyway. Listen, I understand the romantic feelings 
between you two, but ... 
No no no. 
Page 23/33
And. 
How long does it take for to get Coke and pizza, motherfucker? OK? Nonsense! It's ultimately not about caviar and filet mignon. It is enough! I have enough! I'm really pissed off. 
Do you know what the plan? They want us to fumigate. 
The hold out until we give up. 
No no no! Mach spoon with Huff. I ran go. 
Your "caviar and filet mignon" was a clear statement. - Yes? - Listen to. 
You come out now and bring you your ice, 
or I will send in two minutes all my men purely 
and we cut yourselves from your tails! 
Forever! 
We should bring us our ice cream. 
Pretty good. 
- And? - And. 
The streusel are delicious. 
Hirnfrost. 
I do not want to go through again. 
- Did you get it the plan? - Yes, we have figured him. - Look at me, you have it figured? - Go and show it to them. We care remotely for moral support. 
Then a beat. 
- I want to be on top. - OK. I choose the mantra. 
Come on, people fighting, fighting, fighting! Kung fu fight! - All right. - Good mantra. 
Kung Fu, do not let me down.

And after school today dont forget the blood

generously sponsored by the Sullen family. 
Come to the prom! Prom is here! 
Here get your flyer for prom 
Check it out, we finally got a theme. It's gonna be awesome. The theme is Vampires... - We just came out with it randomly. Cool, huh? 
It gonna be like the Festival of St. Salvatore like they have in Italy every year, 
that celebrate the killing of vampires 
They gonna rent out a whole courtyard and 
it will be as if we were in the 15th century. 
It will be super fun, a lot of red capes, a lot of blood and drinking. Are you in? 
-I dont know. Proms not really my thing. 
Well it's my thing! I mean,really Becca what is with you? Prom is like the pivotal moment in any girl's life and I have only 
been dreaming of being Prom queen 
since I was a sperm in my Dad's boxer! 
We need to talk.

and you're obscene from sex. I know what you are!

Wait, what? No, I'm a vampire. Duh.. 
It was my next guess

- Then ask yourself 
the most obvious question. What do we like to eat? 
Vampire cereals? 
You need to see what I really look like 
This is why we dont show ourselves in the summer 
People would know we're different. 
-Oh yeah, shining.. 
-Nah, it's just my body. 
You dont get it, I'm a killer! 
-Are you texting? 
- Yeah, Jennifer! 
[OMG-EDWARD IS SO YUMMY!]

I want to eat you. 
-That's cool. 
Most guys are into that. 
My family ... We are not like other vampires. 
We can control our thirst. To hunt only animals and the real housewives in Atlanta. 
But I dont know if I can control myself around you. 
Look... 
I, I dont like to play games. So ... 
I'm just gonna lay all my cards on the table. I really, like you. I dig that eurotrash heroin chic look. You're totally happening. I want to be with you. 
- I can read everyone's mind.. 
but not yours. You'll have to tell me exactly what you thinking. You're pretty so you dont have to be smart. 
- Will you like to go Prom with me? 
-Yes 
-That's awesome 
The three things I was absolutely positive about. First, Edward is a vampire. Second, American Idol is much better with Ellen and third, the next time I saw Edward, I was gonna hump the shit out of him.

Oh. Oh god, you scared me. 
-There is something that I wanted to try. 
-Me too, I love roleplaying. 
Thats, ehm, that's not what I meant.

I might not be able to resist the urges... to kill you. -I dont mind. 
- What? 
Oh.. Oh yeah, I like it rough. 
Stay away from me. No, please please, dont come any closer. This is for your own safety. I'm trying to protect you. If this is gonna work, we got to take thing slowly 
I guess that's ok, eventhough my teenage hormon are raging and I want to have sex with you. I feel conflicted about 
losing my virginity. I know that you'd never have sex with me because you're a vampires ... 
so, it's really are the ultimate pubescent girl's fantasy -That was incredibly insightful 
- Huh, I read it on Stephanie Meyers Twitter page 
I promise, as long as you're with me, . you will never get hurt. Starting now. 
Oh, shit! I think we all know whatever kill Fisherman Sculley was no animal. 
Look at those traces. This can only mean one thing.

Hey.. there is no reason to be nervous. 
I am different than you. They might not accept me.

That's Alex and Rosalyn. 
I just know we're gonna be great great friends. 
- This is Iris. 
-I hope we will be. 
- No, she already knows that it will happen. 
Some of us have special powers. Iris has visions of the future. Page 9/18

-I'm not on my period 
- You will be. It's coming early this month. 
Relax, Becca. We're just like any normal American family Except of course we have no soul and 
we walk the earth trying to satisfy 
unquenchable thirst for blood. 
-I'm Jeremiah. 
-He's new to the family. 
He's still trying to control his hunger for human. 
Look, I dont want to cause any problems. Maybe I should go. - But you have to open your presents.

Yea, really bad. I hit an artery.

-It's unfair! 
- Come on! 
Someone here ordered Chinese food? 
Quick, they'll be hungry again in half an hour. 
What happened back there could never happen again. 
I now know as long as I'm around you, you'll never be safe. That's why I want you to bite me... 
and turn me into a vampire. 
-No. 
- I keep aging and you stay the same. 
I'm 18 now. I'm practically a cougar. 
I just.. 
I could'nt live with myself. If I turn you into a vampire. You're always sexy and healthy and super good looking with tons of free times 
and money to travel the world. It's a lot like being George Clooney. Seriously, the only thing that keeps aging is... your ass. It's very wrinkly all the time. 
You'll never see me again. 
Just.. promise me that you won't do anything reckless. Okay, I promise that I wont date Chris Brown. 
Farewell. 
Edward.. Edward... 
Edward! 
So, you're just gonna leave me alone in the wood, 
in an areas full of vampire who wanna eat me.

Great! Exactly what I was talking about. 
Take that!

right after they break up with them?

Let's go! 
I'm gonna have to suck the venom out of you. 
Know it, that this will be tough for me 
because the taste of your blood could send me into a frenzy But on the other hand... 
- Just do it already! 
Okay, Edward, I think you got all the venom out. You can stop now. And just like that, Edward was gone. 
I just.. could'nt get over him. Why did he had to leave me? [He's not that into You]

Everyone reminded me of him. 
I could'nt get Edward out of my mind. 
No matter where I looked, 
No matter where I saw, 
without Edward, my life is over.. I felt like dying. 
And every night I had nightmares that would make me scream really really loud.

You're so upset. Let me check your level. 
Oh, It's not good. You got more worse than the secret life of American teenagers. 
You know Honey, I'm not real good at the whole parenting thing, but I do know that breakups are hard. 
especially when you're dumped by someone as handsome and hunky as Edward. That boy can really fill up a pair of pants. 
I mean "Oouuh Look at that~ Look at that~" 
Now let's face it, honey, you're no looker, and you twitch a lot it's kind of irritating. 
That's for sure the best piece of ass you'll ever got.

But you dont need a dress. Because Edward left you behind in the forest like bearshit. 
So I'm gonna wear it instead! And everyone gonna be like, super-jealous. Can you just die!?

Becca, those guys are dangerous. Walk away. 
Oh, shit. Those guys are dangerous. 
- Told ya. 
Wether it was real, or imagine, I knew 
that the more I put myself in danger, 
the more contact I would have with Edward. 
This is your brake, and this is your throttle. 
Jacob, There's a.. there's something different about you. I don't know what is! 
I've been meaning to tell you. 
I'm a mannoberger. 
Are you, telling me.. 
- That's right. I've had my barmitzvah. 
Mussletolf! 
-So you think... 
- I er.. say again. Could'nt hear you. 
Yea right, erm.. 
- What? 
Maybe if you stop revving the bike whenever 
I'm about to ask something really important, you could hear me. Page 12/18

Great, sorry. 
- Thank you. 
Becca, I wanted to ask you.. 
Oh, come on! 
Becca would you wanna date with me? 
- Sorry, but I feel yelled at, Jacob. 
I think I'll just, take her for a spin. 
Just one thing first. 
You just cut the brakelines. 
Becca, stop. You're going to hurt yourselves. 
Put down the guitar and stop singing like Taylor Swift. 
If this is what it takes to be with you Edward. So be it! Becca, don't drink that milk. You know you're lactose intolerant. This is for you, Edward. 
Sorry. But I did try to warn you. 
Are you trying to get yourself killed?! 
You're bleeding. Here! 
Your body is so.. furry!? 
Are.. Are those tits? 
- Yea, several of them actually. 
I'll better get you some help. 
That was fast. 
You are so scrumptous. 
No! 
Be happy it was me that found you.. and not Rachel. 
Why? What happened to Rachel? 
She was.. recasted. 
She wants to torture you, for what you did to Jack. At least I will eat you fast. 
Jacob, run! 
-That's it? A Chiuahua? 
- Oh yea, I guess so. 
-This whole transformation thing is new to me. 
- You can't stop me. 
-You're no werewolf. 
- That's why we always travel in a pack. 
-Please~ 
- Get 'em, girls! 
Sign this! 
Now, let's get you home. 
Why can't Carrie and Big just be together? 
There you are! I've been looking everywhere for you. 
You look like shit. 
-What do you want? 
Page 13/18
Look, we're all sorry we tried to drink Becca's blood, even Jermiah. But something terrible has happened to her. Becca who? I am totally over her. 
I've moved on, I'm done with normal chicks. 
I've finally found someone as freaky as me. 
-Too freaky? 
- Edward, I had a vision 
Becca was driving a motorcycle.. 
She tried to kill herself. 
I fear Becca maybe dead. 
No.. I gotta find out! 
How do you feel? 
I bet it's Edward, isn't it? 
Here. 
[ Rebound Guy : 
Why did you just take off your shirt? 
The contract says I have to, 
every 10 minute of screen time. 
Look, Edward left you, 
but I would never.. do that. 
I wanna take it out of the friends zone. 
I really like you Becca. 
I like you too, when I'm with you... 
-I just feel so safe and secure. 
-Thanks. 
I suppose I always felt with Edward which is all so passion, lust, complete forbidden fruit stuff. -I mean with him it's all about my Va-jay-jay 
- Okay, yeah. 
Do you mind getting that? 
- Hello! 
-Officer Crane!? 
-No, he's not here right now 
- Where is he? 
It's very important that I speak with him. 
" Becca, At the Fisherman Sculley's Funeral. 
Roast is in the oven-- weed is in the top drawer! -Love,Dad " -He's at the funeral 
-Oh God, no! 
Yea, and supposedly the body was so mangled 
that the undertaker had to use .. 
crazy glue to stick the hand back on and 
put marbles where the eyes once were. 
Page 14/18

Hello? Hello? 
-It's true! Becca's dead! 
- Edward, I'm so sorry! 
I can't live without her. 
Goodbye, Iris. I'm going to kill myself. 
I just had another vision about Becca. 
Becca's fine, you don't have to kill yourself anymore. Shit! 
What's the matter, Becca? 
Still no date for the prom? 
Loser! 
Here! Have a drink, bitch! 
Becca, get in the car. Now! 
-What wrong? 
- Edward thinks you're dead. 
Why would he think that? 
Beats me. He won't live without you 
and he wants to die. 
He's such a romantic. 
Becca, don't go. You belong with me. 
I need to know who's it gonna be? 
Me or him? 
I'm not gonna for an answer. I'm not gonna let go. -You tell me, once and for all. 
- Alright! Jacob, I'll tell you 
-I choose.. 
- Cat! 
Edward going to the Volturri to have them kill him. I saw it, I had a vision. 
I had a vision. . - What do you talking about? 
-What are you talking about? Who are the Volturri - They're the evil bloodsucker.. 
who only care about themselves and 
their own mirror vision of the world. 
-They're kind of like "Fox News ". 
- Oh my God! 
Edward's going to expose himself in the sun 
and the Volturri are going to kill him! 
They cannot allow human to know vampires are among them. -It could destroy us. - Okay, where is this going to happen? At the prom. The Volturri never miss a good Salvadore festival. This all the way in Italy. Say what you want about them, but they do know how to party

Just to be sure! 
Becca, you're the only one that can stop Edward. 
You have to show him.. 
-You're still alive. 
- I'll do whatever it takes. 
So.. 
what would you do to save someone you love? 
For Edward, I would stop at nothing. 
Well, you already saw this part, 
so let's get to what happens next.

I'm so sorry. I promise you that I will never leave you again! -The Zolturri are standing right behind me? Arent they? - Yep. 
-Don't worry Becca.. 
- Not talking smack now, are we? 
-Stop it. 
-Stop it. 
-You're killing him. 
-You're killing him. 
-And we haven't even have sex yet. 
-And we haven't even have sex yet.. 
Really? Even? 
-Dad! 
- There you are. 
I was worried about my little girl. There's still a killer on the loose. But I can see you're dancing with your friends. 
So everything's alright. 
Dad, no! You have to know the truth. 
All the killings was done by vampires. 
Edward's one also. And Bobby is a werewolf.

Where's Becca?! 
Surrender, now~ Or Salvator will snap the neck like a Slim Jim. You must pay for exposing yourself. 
Tell you what I'm going to do, Ed? 
I won't kill you, but.. Becca has to become a vampire. -Cool?~ 
-Not cool! 
-No way! Never! 
- Alright~ Pull Edward's head off then.. 
rip his body part and set him on fire. 
- No! no.. no! I mean, Yes! I meant yes!

Holy Shit!

Anyway, I came here to live with my dad, Frank. 
He's the chief of police.

stop the attackers. You have to hit a man where he breathes, Becca. You got quite a kick there. . Good for you!

Good Morning, Sporks High School 
Tickets are now on sale for the prom 
And after school today dont forget the blood 
drive 
generously sponsored by the Sullen family. 
Come to the prom! Prom is here! 
Here get your flyer for prom 
Check it out, we finally got a theme. It's gonna be awesome. The theme is Vampires... - We just came out with it randomly. Cool, huh? 
It gonna be like the Festival of St. Salvatore like they have in Italy every year, 
that celebrate the killing of vampires 
They gonna rent out a whole courtyard and 
it will be as if we were in the 15th century. 
It will be super fun, a lot of red capes, a lot of blood and drinking. Are you in? 
-I dont know. Proms not really my thing. 
Well it's my thing! I mean,really Becca what is with you? Prom is like the pivotal moment in any girl's life and I have only 
been dreaming of being Prom queen 
since I was a sperm in my Dad's boxer! 
We need to talk. 
Your skin is really white, you dress fashionably 
and you're obscene from sex. I know what you are!

- That's right! 
Wait, what? No, I'm a vampire. Duh.. 
It was my next guess 
Page 7/18
- Then ask yourself 
the most obvious question. What do we like to eat? 
Vampire cereals? 
You need to see what I really look like 
This is why we dont show ourselves in the summer 
People would know we're different. 
-Oh yeah, shining.. 
-Nah, it's just my body. 
You dont get it, I'm a killer! 
-Are you texting? 
- Yeah, Jennifer! 
[OMG-EDWARD IS SO YUMMY!] 
[Text to: 
I am one of the most dangerous predators. 
I want to eat you. 
-That's cool. 
Most guys are into that. 
My family ... We are not like other vampires. 
We can control our thirst. To hunt only animals and the real housewives in Atlanta. 
But I dont know if I can control myself around you. 
Look... 
I, I dont like to play games. So ... 
I'm just gonna lay all my cards on the table. I really, like you. I dig that eurotrash heroin chic look. You're totally happening. I want to be with you. 
- I can read everyone's mind.. 
but not yours. You'll have to tell me exactly what you thinking. You're pretty so you dont have to be smart. 
- Will you like to go Prom with me? 
-Yes 
-That's awesome 
The three things I was absolutely positive about. First, Edward is a vampire. Second, American Idol is much better with Ellen and third, the next time I saw Edward, I was gonna hump the shit out of him.

Oh. Oh god, you scared me. 
-There is something that I wanted to try. 
-Me too, I love roleplaying. 
Thats, ehm, that's not what I meant.

I might not be able to resist the urges... to kill you. -I dont mind. 
- What? 
Oh.. Oh yeah, I like it rough. 
Stay away from me. No, please please, dont come any closer. This is for your own safety. I'm trying to protect you. If this is gonna work, we got to take thing slowly 
I guess that's ok, eventhough my teenage hormon are raging and I want to have sex with you. I feel conflicted about 
losing my virginity. I know that you'd never have sex with me because you're a vampires ... 
so, it's really are the ultimate pubescent girl's fantasy -That was incredibly insightful 
- Huh, I read it on Stephanie Meyers Twitter page 
I promise, as long as you're with me, . you will never get hurt. Starting now. 
Oh, shit! I think we all know whatever kill Fisherman Sculley was no animal. 
Look at those traces. This can only mean one thing.

I am different than you. They might not accept me.

I want you to meet my family. 
- You must be Becca. 
I'm Edward's mom, Eden. We've heard so much about you. Fingerfood? 
That's Alex and Rosalyn. 
I just know we're gonna be great great friends. 
- This is Iris. 
-I hope we will be. 
- No, she already knows that it will happen. 
Some of us have special powers. Iris has visions of the future. Page 9/18

-I'm not on my period 
- You will be. It's coming early this month. 
Relax, Becca. We're just like any normal American family Except of course we have no soul and 
we walk the earth trying to satisfy 
unquenchable thirst for blood. 
-I'm Jeremiah. 
-He's new to the family. 
He's still trying to control his hunger for human. 
Look, I dont want to cause any problems. Maybe I should go. - But you have to open your presents.

with Lindsay Lohan.

-It's unfair! 
- Come on! 
Someone here ordered Chinese food? 
Quick, they'll be hungry again in half an hour. 
What happened back there could never happen again. 
I now know as long as I'm around you, you'll never be safe. That's why I want you to bite me... 
and turn me into a vampire. 
-No. 
- I keep aging and you stay the same. 
I'm 18 now. I'm practically a cougar. 
I just.. 
I could'nt live with myself. If I turn you into a vampire. You're always sexy and healthy and super good looking with tons of free times 
and money to travel the world. It's a lot like being George Clooney. Seriously, the only thing that keeps aging is... your ass. It's very wrinkly all the time. 
You'll never see me again. 
Just.. promise me that you won't do anything reckless. Okay, I promise that I wont date Chris Brown. 
Farewell. 
Edward.. Edward... 
Edward! 
So, you're just gonna leave me alone in the wood, 
in an areas full of vampire who wanna eat me.

Great! Exactly what I was talking about. 
Take that! 
-I came here to help, you bitch! 
- Sorry! 
There's no where else to run. Your beloved Edward is not here to save you. Come on, Jack. Where's the bro codes? Huh? 
You know you dont try to eat someone's girlfriend 
right after they break up with them? 
Kardashians. 
Let's go! 
I'm gonna have to suck the venom out of you. 
Know it, that this will be tough for me 
because the taste of your blood could send me into a frenzy But on the other hand... 
- Just do it already! 
Okay, Edward, I think you got all the venom out. You can stop now. And just like that, Edward was gone. 
I just.. could'nt get over him. Why did he had to leave me? [He's not that into You]

[Confessions of a batshit : Love Crazed Teen-age girl] 
Time pass but my yearning for Edward never subsided 
Everyone reminded me of him. 
I could'nt get Edward out of my mind. 
No matter where I looked, 
No matter where I saw, 
without Edward, my life is over.. I felt like dying. 
And every night I had nightmares that would make me scream really really loud. 
Becca, Becca, Becca 
You're so upset. Let me check your level. 
Oh, It's not good. You got more worse than the secret life of American teenagers. 
You know Honey, I'm not real good at the whole parenting thing, but I do know that breakups are hard. 
especially when you're dumped by someone as handsome and hunky as Edward. That boy can really fill up a pair of pants. 
I mean "Oouuh Look at that~ Look at that~"

Owhh, thanks for the spoilers alert dumb shit! 
It's too bad Edward dumped you and now you dont have a date for the prom. Cause that dress would look great on you. 
But you dont need a dress. Because Edward left you behind in the forest like bearshit.

Oh, shit. Those guys are dangerous. 
- Told ya. 
Wether it was real, or imagine, I knew 
that the more I put myself in danger, 
the more contact I would have with Edward. 
This is your brake, and this is your throttle. 
Jacob, There's a.. there's something different about you. I don't know what is! 
I've been meaning to tell you.

Oh, come on!

Just one thing first. 
You just cut the brakelines. 
Becca, stop. You're going to hurt yourselves. 
Put down the guitar and stop singing like Taylor Swift. 
If this is what it takes to be with you Edward. So be it! Becca, don't drink that milk. You know you're lactose intolerant. This is for you, Edward. 
Sorry. But I did try to warn you. 
Are you trying to get yourself killed?!

I really like you Becca. 
I like you too, when I'm with you...

THE BOY WHO LIVED 

Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, 
were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, 
thank you very much. They were the last people you’d 
expect to be involved in anything strange or 
mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such 
nonsense. 

Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called 
Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy 
man with hardly any neck, although he did have a 
very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and 
blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of 
neck, which came in very useful as she spent so 
much of her time craning over garden fences, spying 
on the neighbors. The Dursley s had a small son 
called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer 
boy anywhere. 

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they 
also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that 
somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they 
could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. 
Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t 

Page | 2 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended 
she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her 
good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it 
was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think 
what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in 
the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a 
small son, too, but they had never even seen him. 

This boy was another good reason for keeping the 
Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a 
child like that. 

When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray 
Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the 
cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and 
mysterious things would soon be happening all over 
the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out 
his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley 
gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming 
Dudley into his high chair. 

None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past 
the window. 

At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his 
briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and 
tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because 
Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his 
cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley 
as he left the house. He got into his car and backed 
out of number four’s drive. 

It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the 
first sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a 
map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he 
had seen — then he jerked his head around to look 
again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner 
of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What 
could he have been thinking of? It must have been a 
trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at 
Page | 3 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around 
the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his 
mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet 
Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read 
maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake 
and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward 
town he thought of nothing except a large order of 
drills he was hoping to get that day. 

But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his 
mind by something else. As he sat in the usual 
morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that 
there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people 
about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear 
people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups 
you saw on young people! He supposed this was some 
stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the 
steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these 
weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering 
excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see 
that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that 
man had to be older than he was, and wearing an 
emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it 
struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly 
stunt — these people were obviously collecting for 
something ... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved 
on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the 
Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. 

Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in 
his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might 
have found it harder to concentrate on drills that 
morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in 
broad daylight, though people down in the street did; 
they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after 
owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an 
owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a 
perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five 
different people. He made several important telephone 
Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good 
mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch 
his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a 
bun from the bakery. 

He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he 
passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed 
them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but 
they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering 
excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting 
tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a 
large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words 
of what they were saying. 

“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard — ” 

“ — yes, their son, Harry — ” 

Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He 
looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say 
something to them, but thought better of it. 

He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his 
office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, 
seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing 
his home number when he changed his mind. He put 
the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, 
thinking ... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t 
such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots 
of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. 
Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew 
was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It 
might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no 
point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so 
upset at any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame 
her — if he’d had a sister like that ... but all the 
same, those people in cloaks ... 



Page | 5 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that 
afternoon and when he left the building at five o’clock, 
he was still so worried that he walked straight into 
someone just outside the door. 

“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled 
and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. 
Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet 
cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost 
knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split 
into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that 
made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, 
for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You- 
Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like 
yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy 
day!” 

And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the 
middle and walked off. 

Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been 
hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he 
had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was 
rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, 
hoping he was imagining things, which he had never 
hoped before, because he didn’t approve of 
imagination. 

As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the 
first thing he saw — and it didn’t improve his mood — 
was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It was 
now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the 
same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. 

“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly. 

The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. 

Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. 
Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the 

Page | 6 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




house. He was still determined not to mention 
anything to his wife. 

Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told 
him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems 
with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new 
word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. 
When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the 
living room in time to catch the last report on the 
evening news: 

“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported 
that the nation’s owls have been behaving very 
unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at 
night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have 
been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in 
every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to 
explain why the owls have suddenly changed their 
sleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a 
grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim 
McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more 
showers of owls tonight, Jim?” 

“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about 
that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting 
oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, 
and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that 
instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a 
downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have 
been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until 
next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night 
tonight.” 

Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars 
all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious 
people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a 
whisper about the Potters . . . 



Page | 7 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two 
cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say 
something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er 
— Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister 
lately, have you?” 

As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and 
angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t 
have a sister. 

“No,” she said sharply. “Why?” 

“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. 
“Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of 
funny-looking people in town today ...” 

“So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley. 

“Well, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to 
do with ... you know ... her crowd.” 

Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. 
Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he’d 
heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’t dare. 
Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — 
he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?” 

“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. 

“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?” 

“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.” 

“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking 
horribly. “Yes, I quite agree.” 

He didn’t say another word on the subject as they 
went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the 
bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window 

Page | 8 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




and peered down into the front garden. The cat was 
still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though 
it were waiting for something. 

Was he imagining things? Could all this have 
anything to do with the Potters? If it did ... if it got out 
that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t 
think he could bear it. 

The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep 
quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over 
in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell 
asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, 
there was no reason for them to come near him and 
Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and 
Petunia thought about them and their kind. ... He 
couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up 
in anything that might be going on — he yawned and 
turned over — it couldn’t affect them. ... 

How very wrong he was. 

Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy 
sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no 
sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, 
its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet 
Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door 
slammed on the next street, nor when two owls 
swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight 
before the cat moved at all. 

A man appeared on the corner the cat had been 
watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d 
have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The 
cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. 

Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet 
Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the 
silver of his hair and beard, which were both long 

Page | 9 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long 
robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and 
high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, 
bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles 
and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it 
had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was 
Albus Dumbledore. 

Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had 
just arrived in a street where everything from his 
name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy 
rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But 
he did seem to realize he was being watched, because 
he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still 
staring at him from the other end of the street. For 
some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse 
him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have 
known.” 

He found what he was looking for in his inside 
pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He 
flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. 
The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He 
clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into 
darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, 
until the only lights left on the whole street were two 
tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of 
the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their 
window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they 
wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening 
down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put- 
Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the 
street toward number four, where he sat down on the 
wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a 
moment he spoke to it. 

“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.” 



Page | 10 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. 
Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking 
woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the 
shape of the markings the cat had had around its 
eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. 
Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She 
looked distinctly ruffled. 

“How did you know it was me?” she asked. 

“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.” 

“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all 
day,” said Professor McGonagall. 

“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I 
must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my 
way here.” 

Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. 

“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” she said 
impatiently. “You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, 
but no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s 
going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head 
back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I 
heard it. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars. ... Well, 
they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to 
notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll 
bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much 
sense.” 

“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. 
“We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven 
years.” 

“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. 

“But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are 
being downright careless, out on the streets in broad 

Page | 11 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, 
swapping rumors.” 

She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore 
here, as though hoping he was going to tell her 
something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine 
thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who 
seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found 
out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, 
Dumbledore?” 

“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have 
much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon 
drop?” 

“A what?” 

“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m 
rather fond of.” 

“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as 
though she didn’t think this was the moment for 
lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who has 
gone — ” 

“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like 
yourself can call him by his name? All this You- 
Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been 
trying to persuade people to call him by his proper 
name: Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but 
Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, 
seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we 
keep saying You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any 
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.” 

“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, 
sounding half exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re 
different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You- 
Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.”

“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort 
had powers I will never have.” 



“Only because you’re too — well — noble to use 
them.” 

“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since 
Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.” 

Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at 
Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to 
the rumors that are flying around. You know what 
everyone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared? 

About what finally stopped him?” 

It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the 
point she was most anxious to discuss, the real 
reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all 
day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she 
fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she 
did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was 
saying, she was not going to believe it until 
Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, 
however, was choosing another lemon drop and did 
not answer. 

“What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last 
night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He 
went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and 
James Potter are — are — that they’re — dead.” 

Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall 
gasped. 

“Lily and James ... I can’t believe it ... I didn’t want to 
believe it ... Oh, Albus ...” 

Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the 
shoulder. “I know ... I know ...” he said heavily. 

Page | 13 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went 
on. “That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the 
Potters’ son, Harry. But — he couldn’t. He couldn’t 
kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but 
they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, 
Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why 
he’s gone.” 

Dumbledore nodded glumly. 

“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After 
all he’s done ... all the people he’s killed ... he couldn’t 
kill a little boy? It’s just astounding ... of all the 
things to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven 
did Harry survive?” 

“We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We may 
never know.” 

Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief 
and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. 
Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden 
watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very 
odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; 
instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It 
must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, 
because he put it back in his pocket and said, 
“Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be 
here, by the way?” 

“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t 
suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all 
places?” 

“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. 
They’re the only family he has left now.” 

“You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who 
live here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her 

Page | 14 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 




feet and pointing at number four. “Dumbledore — you 
can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t 
find two people who are less like us. And they’ve got 
this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way 
up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter 
come and live here!” 

“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. 
“His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything 
to him when he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.” 

“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, 
sitting back down on the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, 
you think you can explain all this in a letter? These 
people will never understand him! He’ll be famous — 
a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was 
known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will 
be books written about Harry — every child in our 
world will know his name!” 

“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously 
over the top of his half-moon glasses. “It would be 
enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can 
walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even 
remember! Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be, 
growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take 
it?” 



Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her 
mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re 
right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, 
Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though 
she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. 

“Hagrid’s bringing him.” 

“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with 
something as important as this?” 



Page | 15 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore. 

“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said 
Professor McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t 
pretend he’s not careless. He does tend to — what 
was that?” 

A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around 
them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and 
down the street for some sign of a headlight; it 
swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — 
and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed 
on the road in front of them. 

If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man 
sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a 
normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked 
simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long 
tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his 
face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his 
feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In 
his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of 
blankets. 

“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At 
last. And where did you get that motorcycle?” 

“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the 
giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he 
spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him, 
sir.” 

“No problems, were there?” 

“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him 
out all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ 
around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.” 



Page | 16 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward 
over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a 
baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair 
over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped 
cut, like a bolt of lightning. 

“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall. 

“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Hell have that scar forever.” 

“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?” 

“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. 

I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect 
map of the London Underground. Well — give him 
here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” 

Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned 
toward the Dursleys’ house. 

“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked 
Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry 
and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, 
whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl 
like a wounded dog. 

“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the 
Muggles!” 

“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted 
handkerchief and burying his face in it. “But I c-c- 
can’t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little 
Harry off ter live with Muggles — ” 

“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, 
Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall 
whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as 
Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and 
walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the 
Page | 17 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it 
inside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the 
other two. For a full minute the three of them stood 
and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders 
shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and 
the twinkling light that usually shone from 
Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out. 

“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no 
business staying here. We may as well go and join the 
celebrations.” 

“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’d best 
get this bike away. G ’night, Professor McGonagall — 
Professor Dumbledore, sir.” 

Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid 
swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the 
engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off 
into the night. 

“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” 
said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor 
McGonagall blew her nose in reply. 

Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. 
On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put- 
Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light 
sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive 
glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a 
tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end 
of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets 
on the step of number four. 

“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his 
heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. 

A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which 
lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last 

Page | 18 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




place you would expect astonishing things to happen. 
Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without 
waking up. One small hand closed on the letter 
beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was 
special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he 
would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. 

Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put 
out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next 
few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin 
Dudley. ... He couldn’t know that at this very 
moment, people meeting in secret all over the country 
were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed 
voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” 



Page | 19 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 






THE VANASHIG GLASS 

Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had 
woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but 
Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose 
on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass 
number four on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into 
their living room, which was almost exactly the same 
as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had 
seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the 
photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how 
much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been 
lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach 
ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley 
Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the 
photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first 
bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer 
game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his 
mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy 
lived in the house, too. 

Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, 
but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it 



Page | 20 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the 
day. 

“Up! Get up! Now!” 

Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door 
again. 

“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward 
the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan 
being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and 
tried to remember the dream he had been having. It 
had been a good one. There had been a flying 
motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the 
same dream before. 

His aunt was back outside the door. 

“Are you up yet?” she demanded. 

“Nearly,” said Harry. 

“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the 
bacon. And don’t you dare let it burn, I want 
everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.” 

Harry groaned. 

“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the 
door. 

“Nothing, nothing ...” 

Dudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten? 
Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for 
socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after 
pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry 
was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the 
stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. 
Page | 21 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




When he was dressed he went down the hall into the 
kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all 
Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though 
Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not 
to mention the second television and the racing bike. 
Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a 
mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated 
exercise — unless of course it involved punching 
somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, 
but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, 
but he was very fast. 

Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark 
cupboard, but Harry had always been small and 
skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and 
skinnier than he really was because all he had to 
wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was 
about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin 
face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green 
eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot 
of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had 
punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked 
about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his 
forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He 
had had it as long as he could remember, and the 
first question he could ever remember asking his 
Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. 

“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had 
said. “And don’t ask questions.” 

Don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a 
quiet life with the Dursleys. 

Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was 
turning over the bacon. 

“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning 
greeting. 

Page | 22 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top 
of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a 
haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the 
rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made 
no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over 
the place. 

Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in 
the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like 
Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much 
neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair 
that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia 
often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — 
Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a 
wig. 

Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, 
which was difficult as there wasn’t much room. 
Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His 
face fell. 

“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and 
father. “That’s two less than last year.” 

“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, 
see, it’s here under this big one from Mommy and 
Daddy.” 

“All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red 
in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley 
tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as 
fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. 

Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because 
she said quickly, “And we’ll buy you another two 
presents while we’re out today. How’s that, popkin? 
Two more presents. Is that all right?” 



Page | 23 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard 
work. Finally he said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty ... 
thirty ...” 

“Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia. 

“Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the 
nearest parcel. “All right then.” 

Uncle Vernon chuckled. 

“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his 
father. ’Atta boy, Dudley!” He ruffled Dudley’s hair. 

At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia 
went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon 
watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video 
camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new 
computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the 
paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came 
back from the telephone looking both angry and 
worried. 

“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her 
leg. She can’t take him.” She jerked her head in 
Harry’s direction. 

Dudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart 
gave a leap. Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his 
parents took him and a friend out for the day, to 
adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the 
movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. 
Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. 

Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of 
cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs 
of all the cats she’d ever owned. 

“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at 
Harry as though he’d planned this. Harry knew he 

Page | 24 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, 
but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would 
be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, 
Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. 

“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested. 

“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.” 

The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as 
though he wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was 
something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, 
like a slug. 

“What about what’s-her-name, your friend — 
Yvonne?” 

“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia. 

“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully 
(he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television 
for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s 
computer) . 

Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a 
lemon. 

“And come back and find the house in ruins?” she 
snarled. 

“I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they 
weren’t listening. 

“I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt 
Petunia slowly, "... and leave him in the car. ...” 

“That cars new, he’s not sitting in it alone. ...” 



Page | 25 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really 
crying — it had been years since he’d really cried — 
but he knew that if he screwed up his face and 
wailed, his mother would give him anything he 
wanted. 

“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him 
spoil your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms 
around him. 

“I ... don’t ... want ... him ... t-t-to come!” Dudley 
yelled between huge, pretend sobs. “He always sp- 
spoils everything!” He shot Harry a nasty grin through 
the gap in his mothers arms. 

Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, 
they’re here!” said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a 
moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, 
walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy 
with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who 
held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley 
hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. 

Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his 
luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with 
Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first 
time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able 
to think of anything else to do with him, but before 
they’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. 

“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large 
purple face right up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you 
now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — 
and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until 
Christmas.” 

I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly 



Page | 26 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did. 



The problem was, strange things often happened 
around Harry and it was just no good telling the 
Dursleys he didn’t make them happen. 

Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from 
the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, 
had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair 
so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, 
which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley had 
laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless 
night imagining school the next day, where he was 
already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped 
glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to 
find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt 
Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week 
in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to 
explain that he couldn’t explain how it had grown 
back so quickly. 

Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force 
him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown 
with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it 
over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until 
finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but 
certainly wouldn’t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided 
it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great 
relief, Harry wasn’t punished. 

On the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble 
for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. 
Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, 
as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he 
was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had 
received a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress 
telling them Harry had been climbing school 
buildings. But all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at 
Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his 
Page | 27 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans 
outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the 
wind must have caught him in mid-jump. 

But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even 
worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the 
day somewhere that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or 
Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room. 

While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt 
Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at 
work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry 
were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, 
it was motorcycles. 

"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” 
he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. 

“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, 
remembering suddenly. “It was flying.” 

Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He 
turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, 
his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: 
“MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!” 

Dudley and Piers sniggered. 

“I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.” 

But he wished he hadn’t said anything. If there was 
one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his 
asking questions, it was his talking about anything 
acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a 
dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he 
might get dangerous ideas. 

It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was 
crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley 

Page | 28 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance 
and then, because the smiling lady in the van had 
asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry 
him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It 
wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they 
watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked 
remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond. 

Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. 
He was careful to walk a little way apart from the 
Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting 
to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t 
fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They 
ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a 
tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have 
enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him 
another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. 

Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it 
was all too good to last. 

After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool 
and dark in there, with lit windows all along the 
walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes 
were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and 
stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, 
poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. 
Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It 
could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle 
Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at 
the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was 
fast asleep. 

Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, 
staring at the glistening brown coils. 

“Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon 
tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. 



Page | 29 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped 
the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake 
just snoozed on. 

“This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. 

Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently 
at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it 
had died of boredom itself — no company except 
stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass 
trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than 
having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only 
visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to 
wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the 
house. 

The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, 
very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a 
level with Harry’s. 

It winked. 

Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if 
anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back 
at the snake and winked, too. 

The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and 
Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave 
Harry a look that said quite plainly: 

“I get that all the time.” 

“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though 
he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be 
really annoying.” 

The snake nodded vigorously. 

“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked. 

Page | 30 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the 
glass. Harry peered at it. 

Boa Constrictor, Brazil. 

“Was it nice there?” 

The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again 
and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the 
zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?” 

As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout 
behind Harry made both of them jump. “DUDLEY! 
MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! 
YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!” 

Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he 
could. 

“Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the 
ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the 
concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no 
one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and 
Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the 
next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. 

Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa 
constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was 
uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. 
People throughout the reptile house screamed and 
started running for the exits. 

As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have 
sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come. 
... Thanksss, amigo.” 

The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. 



Page | 31 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass 
go?” " 

The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of 
strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over 
again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as 
Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything 
except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but 
by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, 
Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off 
his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to 
squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at 
least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry 
was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?” 

Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the 
house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he 
could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go — 
cupboard — stay — no meals,” before he collapsed 
into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get 
him a large brandy. 

Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing 
he had a watch. He didn’t know what time it was and 
he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. 

Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the 
kitchen for some food. 

He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten 
miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever 
since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in 
that car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car 
when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he 
strained his memory during long hours in his 
cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a 
blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his 
forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though 
he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came 
from. He couldn’t remember his parents at all. His 
Page | 32 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of 
course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were 
no photographs of them in the house. 

When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and 
dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take 
him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys 
were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or 
maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to 
know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A 
tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once 
while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. 
After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt 
Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without 
buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed 
all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. 

A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually 
shaken his hand in the street the other day and then 
walked away without a word. The weirdest thing 
about all these people was the way they seemed to 
vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. 

At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that 
Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his 
baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody 
liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.

THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE 

The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned 
Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he 
was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer 
holidays had started and Dudley had already broken 
his new video camera, crashed his remote control 
airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, 
knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet 
Drive on her crutches. 

Harry was glad school was over, but there was no 
escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every 
single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were 
all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and 
stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of 
them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite 
sport: Harry Hunting. 

This was why Harry spent as much time as possible 
out of the house, wandering around and thinking 
about the end of the holidays, where he could see a 
tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be 
going off to secondary school and, for the first time in 
Page | 34 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been 
accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, 
Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, 
on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the 
local public school. Dudley thought this was very 
funny. 

“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day 
at Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs 
and practice?” 

“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had 
anything as horrible as your head down it — it might 
be sick.” Then he ran, before Dudley could work out 
what he’d said. 

One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London 
to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. 
Figg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as usual. It turned out 
she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and 
she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She 
let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of 
chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for 
several years. 

That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room 
for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings 
boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, 
and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried 
knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the 
teachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be 
good training for later life. 

As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, 
Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest 
moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and 
said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, 
he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t 



Page | 35 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs 
might already have cracked from trying not to laugh. 



k k k 



There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next 
morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed 
to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He 
went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked 
like dirty rags swimming in gray water. 

“What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips 
tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a 
question. 

“Your new school uniform,” she said. 

Harry looked in the bowl again. 

“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.” 

“Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing 
some of Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just 
like everyone else’s when I’ve finished.” 

Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not 
to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to 
think about how he was going to look on his first day 
at Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old 
elephant skin, probably. 

Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with 
wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry’s new 
uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as 
usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which 
he carried everywhere, on the table. 

They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters 
on the doormat. 

Page | 36 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from 
behind his paper. 

“Make Harry get it.” 

“Get the mail, Harry.” 

“Make Dudley get it.” 

“Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.” 

Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the 
mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard 
from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was 
vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope 
that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry. 

Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging 
like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole 
life, had written to him. Who would? He had no 
friends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the 
library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for 
books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so 
plainly there could be no mistake: 

Mr. H. Potter 

The Cupboard under the Stairs 
4 Privet Drive 
Little Whinging 
Surrey 

The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish 
parchment, and the address was written in emerald- 
green ink. There was no stamp. 



Page | 37 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry 
saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, 
an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large 
letter H. 

“Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the 
kitchen. “What are you doing, checking for letter 
bombs?” He chuckled at his own joke. 

Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his 
letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the 
postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the 
yellow envelope. 

Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, 
and flipped over the postcard. 

“Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny 
whelk ...” 

“Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got 
something!” 

Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which 
was written on the same heavy parchment as the 
envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand 
by Uncle Vernon. 

“That’s mine\” said Harry, trying to snatch it back. 

“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, 
shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at 
it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of 
traffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds 
it was the grayish white of old porridge. 

“P-P-Petunia!” he gasped. 



Page | 38 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle 
Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia 
took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment 
it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her 
throat and made a choking noise. 

“Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!” 

They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten 
that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley 
wasn’t used to being ignored. He gave his father a 
sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. 

“I want to read that letter,” he said loudly. 

“I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.” 

“Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing 
the letter back inside its envelope. 

Harry didn’t move. 

“I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted. 

“Let me see it!” demanded Dudley. 

“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry 
and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw 
them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind 
them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but 
silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; 
Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one 
ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack 
between door and floor. 

“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering 
voice, “look at the address — how could they possibly 
know where he sleeps? You don’t think they’re 
watching the house?” 

Page | 39 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Watching — spying — might be following us,” 
muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. 

“But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write 
back? Tell them we don’t want — ” 

Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes 
pacing up and down the kitchen. 

“No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t 
get an answer. ... Yes, that’s best ... we won’t do 
anything. ...” 

“But — ” 

“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we 
swear when we took him in we’d stamp out that 
dangerous nonsense?” 

That evening when he got back from work, Uncle 
Vernon did something he’d never done before; he 
visited Harry in his cupboard. 

“Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle 
Vernon had squeezed through the door. “Who’s 
writing to me?” 

“No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said 
Uncle Vernon shortly. “I have burned it.” 

“It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my 
cupboard on it.” 

“SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of 
spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep 
breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which 
looked quite painful. 



Page | 40 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt 
and I have been thinking ... you’re really getting a bit 
big for it . . . we think it might be nice if you moved 
into Dudley’s second bedroom.” 

“Why?” said Harry. 

“Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this 
stuff upstairs, now.” 

The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for 
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors 
(usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where 
Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys 
and things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom. It 
only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything 
he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat 
down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly 
everything in here was broken. The month-old video 
camera was lying on top of a small, working tank 
Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor’s 
dog; in the corner was Dudley’s first-ever television 
set, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite 
program had been canceled; there was a large 
birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley 
had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was 
up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley 
had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They 
were the only things in the room that looked as 
though they’d never been touched. 

From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling 
at his mother, “I don’t want him in there ... I need 
that room ... make him get out. ...” 

Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday 
he’d have given anything to be up here. Today he’d 
rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than 
up here without it. 

Page | 41 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. 
Dudley was in shock. He’d screamed, whacked his 
father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, 
kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through 
the greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room 
back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday 
and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. 
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each 
other darkly. 

When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to 
be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get 
it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting 
stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, 
“There’s another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest 
Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive — ’ ” 

With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his 
seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. 
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to 
get the letter from him, which was made difficult by 
the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around 
the neck from behind. After a minute of confused 
fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the 
Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, 
gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in his 
hand. 

“Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he 
wheezed at Harry. “Dudley — go — just go.” 

Harry walked round and round his new room. 
Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and 
they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first 
letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this 
time he’d make sure they didn’t fail. He had a plan. 

The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next 
morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed 

Page | 42 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




silently. He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He stole 
downstairs without turning on any of the lights. 

He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of 
Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. 
His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall 
toward the front door — 

“AAAAARRRGH ! ” 

Harry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something 
big and squashy on the doormat — something alive\ 

Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry 
realized that the big, squashy something had been his 
uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot 
of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making 
sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been 
trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an 
hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. 
Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by 
the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into 
Uncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters 
addressed in green ink. 

“I want — ” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing 
the letters into pieces before his eyes. 

Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at 
home and nailed up the mail slot. 

“See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a 
mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver them they’ll 
just give up.” 

“I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.” 

“Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, 
Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle 

Page | 43 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 




Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of 
fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. 

On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for 
Harry. As they couldn’t go through the mail slot they 
had been pushed under the door, slotted through the 
sides, and a few even forced through the small 
window in the downstairs bathroom. 

Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all 
the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and 
boarded up the cracks around the front and back 
doors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe 
Through the Tulips” as he worked, and jumped at 
small noises. 

On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. 
Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the 
house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two 
dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had 
handed Aunt Petunia through the living room 
window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone 
calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find 
someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the 
letters in her food processor. 

“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” 
Dudley asked Harry in amazement. 



•k k k 



On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the 
breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. 

“No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully 
as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, “no 
damn letters today — ” 



Page | 44 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney 
as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of 
the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came 
pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys 
ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch 
one — 

“Out! OUT!” 

Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and 
threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and 
Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, 
Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could 
hear the letters still streaming into the room, 
bouncing off the walls and floor. 

“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak 
calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at 
the same time. “I want you all back here in five 
minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack 
some clothes. No arguments!” 

He looked so dangerous with half his mustache 
missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later 
they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up 
doors and were in the car, speeding toward the 
highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his 
father had hit him round the head for holding them 
up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and 
computer in his sports bag. 

They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t 
dare ask where they were going. Every now and then 
Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in 
the opposite direction for a while. 

“Shake ’em off ... shake ’em off,” he would mutter 
whenever he did this. 



Page | 45 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall 
Dudley was howling. He’d never had such a bad day 
in his life. He was hungry, he’d missed five television 
programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so 
long without blowing up an alien on his computer. 

Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy- 
looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley 
and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, 
musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, 
sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of 
passing cars and wondering... 

They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on 
toast for breakfast the next day. They had just 
finished when the owner of the hotel came over to 
their table. 

“ ’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I 
got about an ’undred of these at the front desk.” 

She held up a letter so they could read the green ink 
address: 

Mr. H. Potter 

Room 1 7 

Railview Hotel 

Cokeworth 

Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon 
knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared. 

“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up 
quickly and following her from the dining room. 

•k k k 

Page | 46 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt 
Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle 
Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was 
looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into 
the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook 
his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. 
The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed 
field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the 
top of a multilevel parking garage. 

“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt 
Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had 
parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, 
and disappeared. 

It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the 
car. Dudley sniveled. 

“It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great 
Humberto’s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with 
a television.” 

Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was 
Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley to 
know the days of the week, because of television — 
then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh 
birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly 
fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat 
hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, 
you weren’t eleven every day. 

Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was 
also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer 
Aunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought. 

“Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on! 

Everyone out!” 



Page | 47 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was 
pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at 
sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most 
miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing 
was certain, there was no television in there. 

“Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon 
gleefully, clapping his hands together. “And this 
gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!” 

A toothless old man came ambling up to them, 
pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat 
bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. 

“I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, 
“so all aboard!” 

It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain 
crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped 
their faces. After what seemed like hours they 
reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and 
sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. 

The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of 
seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the 
wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. 
There were only two rooms. 

Uncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips 
each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the 
empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. 

“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said 
cheerfully. 

He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought 
nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a 
storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though 
the thought didn’t cheer him up at all. 

Page | 48 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




As night fell, the promised storm blew up around 
them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls 
of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy 
windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in 
the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on 
the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off 
to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find 
the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under 
the thinnest, most ragged blanket. 

The storm raged more and more ferociously as the 
night went on. Harry couldn’t sleep. He shivered and 
turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach 
rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were drowned 
by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. 
The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which was 
dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told 
Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. He lay and 
watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the 
Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the 
letter writer was now. 

Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak 
outside. He hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, 
although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes 
to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so 
full of letters when they got back that he’d be able to 
steal one somehow. 

Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard 
on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what 
was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock 
crumbling into the sea? 

One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds 
... twenty ... ten ... nine — maybe he’d wake Dudley 
up, just to annoy him — three ... two ... one ... 

BOOM. 

Page | 49 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, 
staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking 
to come in. 



Page | 50 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 






THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS 

BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. 

“Where’s the cannon?” he said stupidly. 

There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon 
came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in 
his hands — now they knew what had been in the 
long, thin package he had brought with them. 

“Who’s there?” he shouted. “I warn you — I’m armed!” 

There was a pause. Then — 

SMASH! 

The door was hit with such force that it swung clean 
off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat 
on the floor. 

A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His 
face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy 
mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could 

Page | 51 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under 
all the hair. 

The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so 
that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, 
picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its 
frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. 
He turned to look at them all. 

“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not 
been an easy journey. ...” 

He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen 
with fear. 

“Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger. 

Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, 
who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. 

“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant. 

Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face 
and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. 

“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the 
giant. “Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer 
mom’s eyes.” 

Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. 

“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You 
are breaking and entering!” 

“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the 
giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the 
gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a knot 
as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw 
it into a corner of the room.

Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a 
mouse being trodden on. 

“Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back 
on the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh. Got 
summat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at some 
point, but it’ll taste all right.” 

From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled 
a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with 
trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate 
cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green 
icing. 

Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank 
you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, 
and what he said instead was, “Who are you?” 

The giant chuckled. 

“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, 
Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” 

He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s 
whole arm. 

“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his 
hands together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if 
yeh’ve got it, mind.” 

His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled 
chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the 
fireplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing but 
when he drew back a second later, there was a 
roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with 
flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over 
him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath. 



Page | 53 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged 
under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things 
out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a 
squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, 
several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber 
liquid that he took a swig from before starting to 
make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and 
smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while 
the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, 
juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley 
fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t 
touch anything he gives you, Dudley.” 

The giant chuckled darkly. 

“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ 
anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.” 

He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry 
he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he 
still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as 
nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, 
“I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.” 

The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with 
the back of his hand. 

“Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I 
told yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll 
know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.” 

“Er — no,” said Harry. 

Hagrid looked shocked. 

“Sorry,” Harry said quickly. 

“Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the 
Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. “It’s 

Page | 54 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’ 
yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even 
know abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh 
never wonder where yer parents learned it all?” 

“All what?” asked Harry. 

“ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one 
second!” 

He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill 
the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against 
the wall. 

“Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys, 
“that this boy — this boy! — knows nothin’ abou’ — 
about ANYTHING?” 

Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to 
school, after all, and his marks weren’t bad. 

“I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do 
math and stuff.” 

But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About 
our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’ 
world.” 

“What world?” 

Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. 
“DURSLEY!” he boomed. 

Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered 
something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid 
stared wildly at Harry. 



Page | 55 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he 
said. “I mean, they’re famous. You’re famous.” 

“What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were 
they?” 

“Yeh don’ know ... yeh don’ know ...” Hagrid ran his 
fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a 
bewildered stare. 

“Yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said finally. 

Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. 

“Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid 
you to tell the boy anything!” 

A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have 
quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; 
when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with 
rage. 

“You never told him? Never told him what was in the 
letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw 
Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it from 
him all these years?” 

“Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly. 

“STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. 

Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. 

“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. 
“Harry — yer a wizard.” 

There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and 
the whistling wind could be heard. 



Page | 56 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I’m a what?” gasped Harry. 



“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down 
on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ 
a thumpin’ good’un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained 
up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else 
would yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read 
yer letter.” 

Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the 
yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. 
H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He 
pulled out the letter and read: 

HOGWARTS SCHOOL 
o/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY 

Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE 

(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sore., Chf. 

Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of 
Wizards) 

Dear Mr. Potter, 

We are pleased to inform you that you have been 
accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and 
Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary 
books and equipment. 

Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no 
later than July 31. 

Yours sincerely, 

Minerva McGonagall, 

Deputy Headmistress 



Page | 57 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Questions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks 
and he couldn’t decide which to ask first. After a few 
minutes he stammered, “What does it mean, they 
await my owl?” 

“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, 
clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to 
knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket 
inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, 
rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of 
parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he 
scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: 

Dear Professor Dumbledore, 

Given Harry his letter. 

Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. 

Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well. 

Hagrid 

Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which 
clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw 
the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and 
sat down as though this was as normal as talking on 
the telephone. 

Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it 
quickly. 

“Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, 

Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very 
angry, moved into the firelight. 

“He’s not going,” he said. 

Hagrid grunted. 

Page | 58 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he 
said. 



“A what?” said Harry, interested. 

“A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic 
folk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a 
family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.” 

“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to 
that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp 
it out of him! Wizard indeed!” 

“You knew?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a — a 
wizard?” 

“Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew\ Of 
course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted 
sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just 
like that and disappeared off to that — that school — 
and came home every vacation with her pockets full 
of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the 
only one who saw her for what she was — a freak! 

But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this 
and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in 
the family!” 

She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went 
ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all 
this for years. 

“Then she met that Potter at school and they left and 
got married and had you, and of course I knew you’d 
be just the same, just as strange, just as — as — 
abnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got 
herself blown up and we got landed with you!” 



Page | 59 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his 
voice he said, “Blown up? You told me they died in a 
car crash!” 

“CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily 
that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. “How 
could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter? It’s an 
outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own 
story when every kid in our world knows his name!” 

“But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently. 

The anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked 
suddenly anxious. 

“I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried 
voice. “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there 
might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh 
didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right 
person ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t 
go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.” 

He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. 

“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — 
mind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, 
parts of it. ...” 

He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, 
and then said, “It begins, I suppose, with — with a 
person called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his 
name, everyone in our world knows — ” 

“Who?” 

“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No 
one does.” 

“Why not?” 

Page | 60 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. 
Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard 
who went ... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. 
Worse than worse. His name was ...” 

Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. 

“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested. 

“Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort.” Hagrid 
shuddered. “Don’ make me say it again. Anyway, this 
— this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started 
lookin’ fer followers. Got ’em, too — some were afraid, 
some just wanted a bit o’ his power, ’cause he was 
gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. 
Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly 
with strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things 
happened. He was takin’ over. ’Course, some stood up 
to him — an’ he killed ’em. Horribly. One o’ the only 
safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s 
the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare 
try takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway. 

“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ 
wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwarts 
in their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-Know- 
Who never tried to get ’em on his side before . . . 
probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter 
want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side. 

“Maybe he thought he could persuade ’em ... maybe 
he just wanted ’em outta the way. All anyone knows 
is, he turned up in the village where you was all 
living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a 
year old. He came ter yer house an’ — an’ — ” 

Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted 
handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a 
foghorn. 

Page | 61 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum 
an’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway 



“You-Know-Who killed ’em. An’ then — an’ this is the 
real myst’ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too. 
Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or 
maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do 
it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer 
forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what yeh 
get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took 
care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it 
didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry. 
No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ’em, no one 
except you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches 
an’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, 
the Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you 
lived.” 

Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. 
As Hagrid’s story came to a close, he saw again the 
blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had 
ever remembered it before — and he remembered 
something else, for the first time in his life: a high, 
cold, cruel laugh. 

Hagrid was watching him sadly. 

“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on 
Dumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot ...” 

“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; 
he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. 
Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his 
courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were 
clenched. 

“Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept 
there’s something strange about you, probably 

Page | 62 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as 
for all this about your parents, well, they were 
weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off 
without them in my opinion — asked for all they got, 
getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just 
what I expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky 
end — ” 

But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and 
drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. 
Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, 
“I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one 
more word ...” 

In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella 
by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed 
again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell 
silent. 

“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and 
sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged 
right down to the floor. 

Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, 
hundreds of them. 

“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You- 
Know-Who?” 

“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same 
night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more 
famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see ... he was 
gettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d he go? 

“Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno 
if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say 
he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ 
believe it. People who was on his side came back ter 



Page | 63 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




ours. Some of ’em came outta kinda trances. Don’ 
reckon they could’ve done if he was cornin’ back. 

“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but 
lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause 
somethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There was 
somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on — 
/ dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ 
about you stumped him, all right.” 

Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect 
blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling 
pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a 
horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he 
possibly be? He’d spent his life being clouted by 
Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle 
Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn’t they 
been turned into warty toads every time they’d tried 
to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the 
greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had 
always been able to kick him around like a football? 

“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have 
made a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.” 

To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. 

“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when 
you was scared or angry?” 

Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think 
about it . . . every odd thing that had ever made his 
aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when 
he, Harry, had been upset or angry ... chased by 
Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of 
their reach . . . dreading going to school with that 
ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow 
back . . . and the very last time Dudley had hit him, 



Page | 64 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he 
was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him? 



Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that 
Hagrid was positively beaming at him. 

“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you 
wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.” 

But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a 
fight. 

“Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s 
going to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve 
read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — 
spell books and wands and — ” 

“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop 
him,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s 
son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been 
down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest 
school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven 
years there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with 
youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be 
under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, 
Albus Dumbled — ” 

“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD 
FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle 
Vernon. 

But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his 
umbrella and whirled it over his head, “NEVER — ” he 
thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE 
— IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” 

He brought the umbrella swishing down through the 
air to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet 
light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and 

Page | 65 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with 
his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in 
pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a 
curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers. 

Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and 
Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified 
look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them. 

Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his 
beard. 

“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it 
didn’t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, 
but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there 
wasn’t much left ter do.” 

He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy 
eyebrows. 

“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at 
Hogwarts,” he said. “I’m — er — not supposed ter do 
magic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a bit ter 
follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’ 
the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job — ” 

“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry. 

“Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — 
got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. 
They snapped me wand in half an’ everything. But 
Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great 
man, Dumbledore.” 

“Why were you expelled?” 

“It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” 
said Hagrid loudly. “Gotta get up ter town, get all yer 
books an’ that.” 

Page | 66 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry. 



“You can kip under that,” he said. “Don’ mind if it 
wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in 
one o’ the pockets.” 



Page | 67 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 





DIAGON ALLY 

Harry woke early the next morning. Although he 
could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. 

“It was a dream,” he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a 
giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a 
school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at 
home in my cupboard.” 

There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. 

And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry 
thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn’t open his 
eyes. It had been such a good dream. 

Tap. Tap. Tap. 

“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.” 

He sat up and Hagrid ’s heavy coat fell off him. The 
hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid 
himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there 



Page | 68 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a 
newspaper held in its beak. 

Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as 
though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He 
went straight to the window and jerked it open. The 
owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of 
Hagrid, who didn’t wake up. The owl then fluttered 
onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid ’s coat. 

“Don’t do that.” 

Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it 
snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on 
savaging the coat. 

“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl — ” 

“Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa. 

“What?” 

“He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the 
pockets.” 

Hagrid ’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but 
pockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of 
string, peppermint humbugs, teabags ... finally, Harry 
pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. 

“Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily. 

“Knuts?” 

“The little bronze ones.” 

Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl 
held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a 



Page | 69 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off 
through the open window. 

Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. 

“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter 
London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.” 

Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking 
at them. He had just thought of something that made 
him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had 
got a puncture. 

“Urn — Hagrid?” 

“Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge 
boots. 

“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle 
Vernon last night ... he won’t pay for me to go and 
learn magic.” 

“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up 
and scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents 
didn’t leave yeh anything?” 

“But if their house was destroyed — ” 

“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, 
first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a 
sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no 
teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.” 

“Wizards have banks?” 

“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.” 

Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. 



Page | 70 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Goblins?” 



“Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh 
that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the 
safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter 
keep safe — ’cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’ 
fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore. 
Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself up proudly. 
“He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. 
Fetchin’ you — gettin’ things from Gringotts — knows 
he can trust me, see. 

“Got everythin’? Come on, then.” 

Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was 
quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. 
The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with 
a lot of water in the bottom after the storm. 

“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around 
for another boat. 

“Flew,” said Hagrid. 

“Flew?” 

“Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter 
use magic now I’ve got yeh.” 

They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at 
Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying. 

“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving 
Harry another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er 
— speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not 
mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?” 

“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. 
Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it 

Page | 71 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward 
land. 

“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” 
Harry asked. 

“Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his 
newspaper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons 
guardin’ the high-security vaults. And then yeh gotta 
find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under 
London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die 
of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter 
get yer hands on summat.” 

Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read 
his newspaper, the Daily Prophet Harry had learned 
from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone 
while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d 
never had so many questions in his life. 

“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid 
muttered, turning the page. 

“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he 
could stop himself. 

“ ’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer 
Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so 
old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there 
was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every 
morning, askin’ fer advice.” 

“But what does a Ministry of Magic do?” 

“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles 
that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the 
country.” 

“Why?” 

Page | 72 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d be wantin’ magic 
solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left 
alone.” 

At this moment the boat bumped gently into the 
harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and 
they clambered up the stone steps onto the street. 

Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked 
through the little town to the station. Harry couldn’t 
blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as 
anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary 
things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See 
that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” 

“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep 
up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?” 

“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a 
dragon.” 

“You’d like one?” 

“Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.” 

They had reached the station. There was a train to 
London in five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t 
understand “Muggle money,” as he called it, gave the 
bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets. 

People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid 
took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a 
canary-yellow circus tent. 

“Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted 
stitches. 

Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. 



Page | 73 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything 
yeh need.” 



Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t 
noticed the night before, and read:

“Can we buy all this in London?” Harry wondered 
aloud. 

“If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid. 

Harry had never been to London before. Although 
Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was 
obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary 
way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the 
Underground, and complained loudly that the seats 
were too small and the trains too slow. 

Page | 75 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without 
magic,” he said as they climbed a broken-down 
escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with 
shops. 

Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; 
all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They 
passed book shops and music stores, hamburger 
restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as 
if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an 
ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there 
really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath 
them? Were there really shops that sold spell books 
and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge 
joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t 
known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he 
might have thought so; yet somehow, even though 
everything Hagrid had told him so far was 
unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting him. 

“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky 
Cauldron. It’s a famous place.” 

It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t 
pointed it out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was 
there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it. Their 
eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the 
record shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the 
Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most 
peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. 
Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him 
inside. 

For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A 
few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny 
glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long 
pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old 
bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a 
toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped 
Page | 76 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know 
Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the 
bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, 
Hagrid?” 

“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, 
clapping his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and 
making Harry’s knees buckle. 

“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is 
this — can this be — ?” 

The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely 
still and silent. 

“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry 
Potter ... what an honor.” 

He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward 
Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. 

“Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.” 

Harry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking 
at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it 
without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was 
beaming. 

Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the 
next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands 
with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron. 

“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting 
you at last.” 

“So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.” 

“Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a 
flutter.” 

Page | 77 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the 
name, Dedalus Diggle.” 

“I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s 
top hat fell off in his excitement. “You bowed to me 
once in a shop.” 

“He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking 
around at everyone. “Did you hear that? He 
remembers me!” 

Harry shook hands again and again — Doris 
Crockford kept coming back for more. 

A pale young man made his way forward, very 
nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. 

“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor 
Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” 

“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping 
Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to 
meet you.” 

“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?” 

“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered 
Professor Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think 
about it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” 

He laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your 
equipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b- 
book on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at 
the very thought. 

But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep 
Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get 
away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make 
himself heard over the babble. 



Page | 78 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.” 

Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, 
and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a 
small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but 
a trash can and a few weeds. 

Hagrid grinned at Harry. 

“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even 
Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind 
you, he’s usually tremblin’.” 

“Is he always that nervous?” 

“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine 
while he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a 
year off ter get some firsthand experience. ... They say 
he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a 
nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same 
since. Scared of the students, scared of his own 
subject — now, where’s me umbrella?” 

Vampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. 

Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall 
above the trash can. 

“Three up ... two across ...” he muttered. “Right, 
stand back, Harry.” 

He tapped the wall three times with the point of his 
umbrella. 

The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in 
the middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider 
and wider — a second later they were facing an 
archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway 
onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of 
sight. 

Page | 79 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.” 

He grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped 
through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his 
shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back 
into solid wall. 

The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons 
outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes — 
Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring — 
Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. 

“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we 
gotta get yer money first.” 

Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He 
turned his head in every direction as they walked up 
the street, trying to look at everything at once: the 
shops, the things outside them, the people doing their 
shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary 
was shaking her head as they passed, saying, 

“Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad.” 

A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign 
saying Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, 
Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about 
Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window 
with broomsticks in it. “Look,” Harry heard one of 
them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest 
ever — ” There were shops selling robes, shops selling 
telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had 
never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of 
bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell 
books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, 
globes of the moon. ... 

“Gringotts,” said Hagrid. 



Page | 80 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




They had reached a snowy white building that 
towered over the other little shops. Standing beside 
its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of 
scarlet and gold, was — 

“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they 
walked up the white stone steps toward him. The 
goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a 
swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry 
noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they 
walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of 
doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon 
them: 

Enter, stranger, but take heed 

Of what awaits the sin of greed, 

For those who take, but do not earn, 

Must pay most dearly in their turn. 

So if you seek beneath our floors 

A treasure that was never yours, 

Thief, you have been warned, beware 

Of finding more than treasure there. 

“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said 
Hagrid. 

A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors 
and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred 
more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long 
counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in 
brass scales, examining precious stones through 
eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count 
Page | 81 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were 
showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry 
made for the counter. 

“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come 
ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” 

“You have his key, sir?” 

“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started 
emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a 
handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of 
numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry 
watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of 
rubies as big as glowing coals. 

“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden 
key. 

The goblin looked at it closely. 

“That seems to be in order.” 

“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor 
Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out 
his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault 
seven hundred and thirteen.” 

The goblin read the letter carefully. 

“Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will 
have someone take you down to both vaults. 
Griphook!” 

Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had 
crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, 
he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the 
doors leading off the hall. 



Page | 82 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred 
and thirteen?” Harry asked. 

“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very 
secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. 
More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.” 

Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who 
had expected more marble, was surprised. They were 
in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming 
torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were 
little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled 
and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward 
them. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty 
— and were off. 

At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting 
passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, 
left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The 
rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because 
Griphook wasn’t steering. 

Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, 
but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw 
a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted 
around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they 
plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake 
where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the 
ceiling and floor. 

“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise 
of the cart, “what’s the difference between a 
stalagmite and a stalactite?” 

“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ 
ask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be 
sick.” 



Page | 83 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at 
last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid 
got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his 
knees from trembling. 

Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke 
came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. 
Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. 
Heaps of little bronze Knuts. 

“All yours,” smiled Hagrid. 

All Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t 
have known about this or they’d have had it from him 
faster than blinking. How often had they complained 
how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time 
there had been a small fortune belonging to him, 
buried deep under London. 

Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. 

“The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. 

“Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine 
Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should 
be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest 
safe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault seven 
hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go 
more slowly?” 

“One speed only,” said Griphook. 

They were going even deeper now and gathering 
speed. The air became colder and colder as they 
hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over 
an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the 
side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, 
but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff 
of his neck. 



Page | 84 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. 

“Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked 
the door gently with one of his long fingers and it 
simply melted away. 

“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be 
sucked through the door and trapped in there,” said 
Griphook. 

“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” 
Harry asked. 

“About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a 
rather nasty grin. 

Something really extraordinary had to be inside this 
top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned 
forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at 
the very least — but at first he thought it was empty. 
Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up 
in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up 
and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to 
know what it was, but knew better than to ask. 

“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to 
me on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth 
shut,” said Hagrid. 



One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the 
sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where 
to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He 
didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to 
a pound to know that he was holding more money 
than he’d had in his whole life — more money than 
even Dudley had ever had. 



Page | 85 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding 
toward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. 
“Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a 
pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them 
Gringotts carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so Harry 
entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous. 

Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all 
in mauve. 

“Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to 
speak. “Got the lot here — another young man being 
fitted up just now, in fact.” 

In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed 
face was standing on a footstool while a second witch 
pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood 
Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over 
his head, and began to pin it to the right length. 

“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?” 

“Yes,” said Harry. 

“My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s 
up the street looking at wands,” said the boy. He had 
a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m going to drag them 
off to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years 
can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully father into 
getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.” 

Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. 

“Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on. 

“No,” said Harry. 

“Play Quidditch at all?” 



Page | 86 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth 
Quidditch could be. 

“ I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to 
play for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know 
what House you 11 be in yet?” 

“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. 

“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do 
they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family 
have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d 
leave, wouldn’t you?” 

“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a 
bit more interesting. 

“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, 
nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was 
standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two 
large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in. 

“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know 
something the boy didn’t. “He works at Hogwarts.” 

“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of 
servant, isn’t he?” 

“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the 
boy less and less every second. 

“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a 
hut on the school grounds and every now and then he 
gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire 
to his bed.” 

“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly. 



Page | 87 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he 
with you? Where are your parents?” 

“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel 
much like going into the matter with this boy. 

“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. 
“But they were our kind, weren’t they?” 

“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you 
mean.” 

“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, 
do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been 
brought up to know our ways. Some of them have 
never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, 
imagine. I think they should keep it in the old 
wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?” 

But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, 
“That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for 
an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down 
from the footstool. 

“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the 
drawling boy. 

Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid 
had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with 
chopped nuts). 

“What’s up?” said Hagrid. 

“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment 
and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a 
bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When 
they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s 
Quidditch?” 



Page | 88 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — 
not knowin’ about Quidditch!” 

“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told 
Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s. 

“ — and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t 
even be allowed in — ” 

“Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh 
were — he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his 
parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in 
the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. 
Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best 
I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a 
long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what 
she had fer a sister!” 

“So what is Quidditch?” 

“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in 
the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — 
played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four 
balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.” 

“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?” 

“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says 
Hufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but — ” 

“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily. 

“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. 
“There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad 
who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.” 

“Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?” 

“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid. 

Page | 89 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called 
Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to 
the ceiling with books as large as paving stones 
bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in 
covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a 
few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, 
who never read anything, would have been wild to get 
his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to 
drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses 
(Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies 
with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, 
Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor 
Vindictus Viridian. 

“I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.” 

“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter 
use magic in the Muggle world except in very special 
circumstances,” said Hagrid. “An’ anyway, yeh 
couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot 
more study before yeh get ter that level.” 

Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, 
either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice 
set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a 
collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the 
Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make 
up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and 
rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the 
floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders 
lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, 
and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While 
Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a 
supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, 
Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at 
twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery- 
black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). 



Page | 90 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list 
again. 

“Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got 
yeh a birthday present.” 

Harry felt himself go red. 

“You don’t have to — ” 

“I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer 
animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years 
ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats, they 
make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want 
owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ 
everythin’.” 

Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl 
Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling 
and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a 
large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep 
with her head under her wing. He couldn’t stop 
stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor 
Quirrell. 

“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect 
you’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just 
Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands, 
Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.” 

A magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really 
looking forward to. 

The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold 
letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine 
Wands since 382b. c. A single wand lay on a faded 
purple cushion in the dusty window.

A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the 
shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, 
empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid 
sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had 
entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new 
questions that had just occurred to him and looked 
instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly 
right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of 
his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here 
seemed to tingle with some secret magic. 

“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. 
Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a 
loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the 
spindly chair. 

An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale 
eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the 
shop. 

“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly. 

“Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be 
seeing you soon. Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. 
“You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday 
she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten 
and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. 
Nice wand for charm work.” 

Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished 
he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. 

“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany 
wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and 
excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father 
favored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the 
wizard, of course.”

Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry 
were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself 
reflected in those misty eyes. 

“And that’s where ...” 

Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s 
forehead with a long, white finger. 

“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said 
softly. “Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful 
wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands ... well, 
if I’d known what that wand was going out into the 
world to do. ...” 

He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted 
Hagrid. 

“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. 

... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?” 

“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid. 

“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it 
in half when you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, 
suddenly stern. 

“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his 
feet. “I’ve still got the pieces, though,” he added 
brightly. 

“But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander 
sharply. 

“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he 
gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. 

“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a 
piercing look. “Well, now — Mr. Potter. Let me see.” 

Page | 93 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings 
out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?” 

“Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry. 

“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry 
from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder 
to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he 
measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core 
of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use 
unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the 
heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are 
the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or 
phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will 
never get such good results with another wizard’s 
wand.” 

Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which 
was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this 
on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the 
shelves, taking down boxes. 

“That will do,” he said, and the tape measure 
crumpled into a heap on the floor. “Right then, Mr. 
Potter. Try this one. Beech-wood and dragon 
heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take 
it and give it a wave.” 

Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it 
around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his 
hand almost at once. 

“Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite 
whippy. Try — ” 

Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand 
when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. 



Page | 94 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a 
half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.” 

Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. 
Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands 
was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, 
but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the 
shelves, the happier he seemed to become. 

“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, well find the 
perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — 
yes, why not — unusual combination — holly and 
phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.” 

Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his 
fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it 
swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of 
red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, 
throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid 
whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh, 
bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well ... 
how curious ... how very curious ...” 

He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it 
in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious . . . curious 



“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?” 

Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. 

“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. 
Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix 
whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another 
feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed 
that you should be destined for this wand when its 
brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.” 



Harry swallowed. 

Page | 95 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed 
how these things happen. The wand chooses the 
wizard, remember. ... I think we must expect great 
things from you, Mr. Potter. ... After all, He-Who- 
Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, 
but great.” 

Harry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. 

Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for 
his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his 
shop. 

The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry 
and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, 
back through the wall, back through the Leaky 
Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as 
they walked down the road; he didn’t even notice how 
much people were gawking at them on the 
Underground, laden as they were with all their funny- 
shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its 
cage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into 
Paddington station; Harry only realized where they 
were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. 

“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he 
said. 

He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on 
plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. 
Everything looked so strange, somehow. 

“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid. 

Harry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the 
best birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his 
hamburger, trying to find the words. 

“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All 
those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor 

Page | 96 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander ... but I don’t know anything 
about magic at all. How can they expect great things? 
I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m 
famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-, 
sorry — I mean, the night my parents died.” 

Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard 
and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. 

“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. 
Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll 
be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve 
been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll 
have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, 
’smatter of fact.” 

Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take 
him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an 
envelope. 

“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” he said. “First o’ September 
— King’s Cross — it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems 
with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll 
know where to find me. ... See yeh soon, Harry.” 

The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to 
watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his 
seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he 
blinked and Hagrid had gone. 



Page | 97 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 







THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM 
NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS 

Harry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. 
True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t 
stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle 
Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him 
to do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t 
speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they 
acted as though any chair with Harry in it were 
empty. Although this was an improvement in many 
ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. 

Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for 
company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name 
he had found in A History of Magic. His school books 
were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late 
into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the 
open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt 
Petunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because 
Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night 
before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day 



Page | 98 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, 
counting down to September the first. 

On the last day of August he thought he’d better 
speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King’s 
Cross station the next day, so he went down to the 
living room where they were watching a quiz show on 
television. He cleared his throat to let them know he 
was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the 
room. 

“Er — Uncle Vernon?” 

Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. 

“Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to 
go to Hogwarts.” 

Uncle Vernon grunted again. 

“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?” 

Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. 

“Thank you.” 

He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon 
actually spoke. 

“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. 
Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?” 

Harry didn’t say anything. 

“Where is this school, anyway?” 

“I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first 
time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of 
his pocket. 

Page | 99 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I just take the train from platform nine and three- 
quarters at eleven o’clock,” he read. 

His aunt and uncle stared. 

“Platform what?” 

“Nine and three-quarters.” 

“Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no 
platform nine and three-quarters.” 

“It’s on my ticket.” 

“Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of 
them. You 11 see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take 
you to King’s Cross. We’re going up to London 
tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.” 

“Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying 
to keep things friendly. 

“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle 
Vernon. “Got to have that ruddy tail removed before 
he goes to Smeltings.” 

Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was 
too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up 
and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to 
walk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d 
change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet 
again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw 
that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then 
paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. 
Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been 
loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had 
talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had 
set off. 



Page | 100 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle 
Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and 
wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this 
was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, 
facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. 

“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform 
ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the 
middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do 
they?” 

He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic 
number nine over one platform and a big plastic 
number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, 
nothing at all. 

“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even 
nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry 
turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of 
them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. 
What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to 
attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d 
have to ask someone. 

He stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention 
platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had 
never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t 
even tell him what part of the country it was in, he 
started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being 
stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for 
the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said 
there wasn’t one. In the end the guard strode away, 
muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying 
hard not to panic. According to the large clock over 
the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on 
the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; 
he was stranded in the middle of a station with a 
trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard 
money, and a large owl. 

Page | 101 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you 
had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to 
get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get 
out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s 
stand between platforms nine and ten. 

At that moment a group of people passed just behind 
him and he caught a few words of what they were 
saying. 

“ — packed with Muggles, of course — ” 

Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump 
woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming 
red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like 
Harry’s in front of him — and they had an owl. 

Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. 
They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear 
what they were saying. 

“Now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’ 
mother. 

“Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red- 
headed, who was holding her hand, “Mom, can’t I go 



“You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, 
Percy, you go first.” 

What looked like the oldest boy marched toward 
platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to 
blink in case he missed it — but just as the boy 
reached the dividing barrier between the two 
platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in 
front of him and by the time the last backpack had 
cleared away, the boy had vanished. 



Page | 102 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said. 



“I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly, 
woman, you call yourself our mother? Can’t you tell 
I’m George?” 

“Sorry, George, dear.” 

“Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he 
went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he 
must have done so, because a second later, he had 
gone — but how had he done it? 

Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the 
barrier — he was almost there — and then, quite 
suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere. 

There was nothing else for it. 

“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman. 

“Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s 
new, too.” 

She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He 
was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands 
and feet, and a long nose. 

“Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is — the thing is, I don’t 
know how to — ” 

“How to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and 
Harry nodded. 

“Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk 
straight at the barrier between platforms nine and 
ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into 
it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if 
you’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.” 

Page | 103 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Er — okay,” said Harry. 

He pushed his trolley around and stared at the 
barrier. It looked very solid. 

He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on 
their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked 
more quickly. He was going to smash right into that 
barrier and then he’d be in trouble — leaning forward 
on his cart, he broke into a heavy run — the barrier 
was coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn’t be able 
to stop — the cart was out of control — he was a foot 
away — he closed his eyes ready for the crash — 

It didn’t come ... he kept on running ... he opened his 
eyes. 

A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform 
packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts 
Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind him and 
saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had 
been, with the words Platform Nine and Three- 
Quarters on it. He had done it. 

Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the 
chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound 
here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one 
another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble 
and the scraping of heavy trunks. 

The first few carriages were already packed with 
students, some hanging out of the window to talk to 
their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed 
his cart off down the platform in search of an empty 
seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, 
“Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.” 

“Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh. 



Page | 104 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small 
crowd. 



“Give us a look, Lee, go on.” 

The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the 
people around him shrieked and yelled as something 
inside poked out a long, hairy leg. 

Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found 
an empty compartment near the end of the train. He 
put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and 
heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift 
it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and 
twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. 

“Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins 
he’d followed through the barrier. 

“Yes, please,” Harry panted. 

“Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!” 

With the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked 
away in a corner of the compartment. 

“Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of 
his eyes. 

“What’s that?” said one of the twins suddenly, 
pointing at Harry’s lightning scar. 

“Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you — ?” 

“He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to 
Harry. 

“What?” said Harry. 

Page | 105 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“ Harry Potter,” chorused the twins. 

“Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.” 

The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself 
turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating 
in through the train’s open door. 

“Fred? George? Are you there?” 

“Coming, Mom.” 

With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the 
train. 

Harry sat down next to the window where, half 
hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the 
platform and hear what they were saying. Their 
mother had just taken out her handkerchief. 

“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.” 

The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she 
grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. 

“Mom — geroff.” He wriggled free. 

“Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?” 
said one of the twins. 

“Shut up,” said Ron. 

“Where’s Percy?” said their mother. 

“He’s coming now.” 

The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had 
already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts 



Page | 106 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge 
on his chest with the letter P on it. 

“Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the 
prefects have got two compartments to themselves — ” 

“Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the twins, 
with an air of great surprise. “You should have said 
something, we had no idea.” 

“Hang on, I think I remember him saying something 
about it,” said the other twin. “Once — ” 

“Or twice — ” 

“A minute — ” 

“All summer — ” 

“Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect. 

“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one 
of the twins. 

“Because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. “All 
right, dear, well, have a good term — send me an owl 
when you get there.” 

She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she 
turned to the twins. 

“Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I 
get one more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up 
a toilet or — ” 

“Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.” 
“Great idea though, thanks, Mom.” 



Page | 107 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s not funny. And look after Ron.” 

“Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.” 

“Shut up,” said Ron again. He was almost as tall as 
the twins already and his nose was still pink where 
his mother had rubbed it. 

“Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on 
the train?” 

Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him 
looking. 

“You know that black-haired boy who was near us in 
the station? Know who he is?” 

“Who?” 

“ Harry Potted” 

Harry heard the little girl’s voice. 

“Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, 
oh please. ...” 

“You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy 
isn’t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, 
Fred? How do you know?” 

“Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there — like 
lightning.” 

“Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He 
was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the 
platform.” 

“Never mind that, do you think he remembers what 
You-Know-Who looks like?” 

Page | 108 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Their mother suddenly became very stern. 



“I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As 
though he needs reminding of that on his first day at 
school.” 

“All right, keep your hair on.” 

A whistle sounded. 

“Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys 
clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the 
window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their 
younger sister began to cry. 

“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.” 

“Well send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.” 

“ Georg e\” 

“Only joking, Mom.” 

The train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother 
waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, 
running to keep up with the train until it gathered too 
much speed, then she fell back and waved. 

Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as 
the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the 
window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He 
didn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be 
better than what he was leaving behind. 

The door of the compartment slid open and the 
youngest redheaded boy came in. 

“Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat 
opposite Harry. “Everywhere else is full.” 

Page | 109 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He 
glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the 
window, pretending he hadn’t looked. Harry saw he 
still had a black mark on his nose. 

“Hey, Ron.” 

The twins were back. 

“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — 

Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.” 

“Right,” mumbled Ron. 

“Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce 
ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, 
our brother. See you later, then.” 

“Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the 
compartment door shut behind them. 

“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out. 

Harry nodded. 

“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and 
George’s jokes,” said Ron. “And have you really got — 
you know ...” 

He pointed at Harry’s forehead. 

Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning 
scar. Ron stared. 

“So that’s where You-Know-Who — ?” 

“Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.” 

“Nothing?” said Ron eagerly. 

Page | 110 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing 
else.” 



“Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few 
moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized 
what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the 
window again. 

“Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found 
Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. 

“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a 
second cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk 
about him.” 

“So you must know loads of magic already.” 

The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding 
families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked 
about. 

“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. 
“What are they like?” 

“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle 
and cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard 
brothers.” 

“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking 
gloomy. “I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. 
You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and 
Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and 
Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a 
prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they 
still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re 
really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the 
others, but if I do, it’s no big deal, because they did it 
first. You never get anything new, either, with five 

Page | 111 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




brothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, 
and Percy’s old rat.” 

Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat 
gray rat, which was asleep. 

“His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever 
wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being 
made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got 
Scabbers instead.” 

Ron’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said 
too much, because he went back to staring out of the 
window. 

Harry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not 
being able to afford an owl. After all, he’d never had 
any money in his life until a month ago, and he told 
Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes 
and never getting proper birthday presents. This 
seemed to cheer Ron up. 

"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything 
about being a wizard or about my parents or 
Voldemort — ” 

Ron gasped. 

“What?” said Harry. 

“ You said You-Know-Who’s name\” said Ron, sounding 
both shocked and impressed. “I’d have thought you, 
of all people — ” 

“I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the 
name,” said Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t. 
See what I mean? I’ve got loads to learn. ... I bet,” he 
added, voicing for the first time something that had 



Page | 112 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




been worrying him a lot lately, “I bet I’m the worst in 
the class.” 

“You won’t be. There’s loads of people who come from 
Muggle families and they learn quick enough.” 

While they had been talking, the train had carried 
them out of London. Now they were speeding past 
fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a 
time, watching the fields and lanes flick past. 

Around half past twelve there was a great clattering 
outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman 
slid back their door and said, “Anything off the cart, 
dears?” 

Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, 
but Ron’s ears went pink again and he muttered that 
he’d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the 
corridor. 

He had never had any money for candy with the 
Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with 
gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars 
Bars as he could carry — but the woman didn’t have 
Mars Bars. What she did have were Bertie Bott’s 
Every Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, 
Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, 
Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things 
Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss 
anything, he got some of everything and paid the 
woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. 

Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the 
compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. 

“Hungry, are you?” 



Page | 113 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a 
pumpkin pasty. 

Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped 
it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one 
of them apart and said, “She always forgets I don’t 
like corned beef.” 

“Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a 
pasty. “Go on — ” 

“You don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said Ron. “She 
hasn’t got much time,” he added quickly, “you know, 
with five of us.” 

“Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had 
anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share 
it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, 
eating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes, 
and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). 

“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a 
pack of Chocolate Frogs. “They’re not really frogs, are 
they?” He was starting to feel that nothing would 
surprise him. 

“No,” said Ron. “But see what the card is. I’m missing 
Agrippa.” 

“What?” 

“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs 
have cards inside them, you know, to collect — 
famous witches and wizards. I’ve got about five 
hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.” 

Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up 
the card. It showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon 
glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver 

Page | 114 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture 
was the name Albus Dumbledore. 



“So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry. 

“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said 
Ron. “Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks 



Harry turned over his card and read: 

ALBUS DUMBLEDORE 

CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS 

Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern 
times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his 
defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the 
discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his 
work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. 
Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten 
pin bowling. 

Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his 
astonishment, that Dumbledore ’s face had 
disappeared. 

“He’s gone!” 

“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” 
said Ron. “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again 
and I’ve got about six of her ... do you want it? You 
can start collecting.” 

Ron’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs 
waiting to be unwrapped. 

“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the 
Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.” 

Page | 115 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded 
amazed. “Weird).” 



Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the 
picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron 
was more interested in eating the frogs than looking 
at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry 
couldn’t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only 
Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, 
Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He 
finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, 
who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie 
Bott’s Every Flavor Beans. 

“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned 
Harry. “When they say every flavor, they mean every 
flavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones like 
chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then 
you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George 
reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.” 

Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, 
and bit into a corner. 

“Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.” 

They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. 
Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, 
curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave 
enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron 
wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper. 

The countryside now flying past the window was 
becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there 
were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. 

There was a knock on the door of their compartment 
and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on 

Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked 
tearful. 



“Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?” 

When they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost 
him! He keeps getting away from me!” 

“Hell turn up,” said Harry. 

“Yes,” said the boy miserably. “Well, if you see him ...” 
He left. 

“Don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d 
brought a toad I’d lose it as quick as I could. Mind 
you, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t talk.” 

The rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap. 

“He might have died and you wouldn’t know the 
difference,” said Ron in disgust. “I tried to turn him 
yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but 
the spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look ...” 

He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a 
very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places 
and something white was glinting at the end. 

“Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway — ” 

He had just raised his wand when the compartment 
door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but 
this time he had a girl with him. She was already 
wearing her new Hogwarts robes. 

“Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said. 
She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown 
hair, and rather large front teeth. 

Page | 117 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron, 
but the girl wasn’t listening, she was looking at the 
wand in his hand. 

“Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.” 

She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. 

“Er — all right.” 

He cleared his throat. 

“ Sunshine , daisies, butter mellow, 

Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.” 

He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers 
stayed gray and fast asleep. 

“Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, 
it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells 
just for practice and it’s all worked for me. Nobody in 
my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise 
when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of 
course, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft 
there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books 
by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I’m 
Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?” 

She said all this very fast. 

Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his 
stunned face that he hadn’t learned all the course 
books by heart either. 

“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered. 

“Harry Potter,” said Harry. 



Page | 118 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about 
you, of course — I got a few extra books for 
background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical 
History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and 
Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.” 

“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed. 

“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out 
everything I could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do 
either of you know what House you’ll be in? I’ve been 
asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds 
by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, 
but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad. ... 
Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. 

You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll 
be there soon.” 

And she left, taking the toadless boy with her. 

“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said 
Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. “Stupid 
spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a 
dud.” 

“What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry. 

“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling 
on him again. “Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t 
know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t suppose 
Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put 
me in Slytherin.” 

“That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was 
in?” 



“Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, 
looking depressed. 



Page | 119 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are 
a bit lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off 
Houses. “So what do your oldest brothers do now that 
they’ve left, anyway?” 

Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d 
finished school. 

“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in 
Africa doing something for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did 
you hear about Gringotts? It’s been all over the Daily 
Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the 
Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security 
vault.” 

Harry stared. 

“Really? What happened to them?” 

“Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t 
been caught. My dad says it must’ve been a powerful 
Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don’t 
think they took anything, that’s what’s odd. ’Course, 
everyone gets scared when something like this 
happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.” 

Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was 
starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know- 
Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of 
entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more 
comfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying. 

“What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked. 

“Er — I don’t know any,” Harry confessed. 

“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s 
the best game in the world — ” And he was off, 
explaining all about the four balls and the positions of 

Page | 120 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




the seven players, describing famous games he’d been 
to with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like to 
get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry 
through the finer points of the game when the 
compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t 
Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this 
time. 

Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle 
one at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s 
robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more 
interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley. 

“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train 
that Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is 
it?” 



“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. 
Both of them were thickset and looked extremely 
mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they 
looked like bodyguards. 

“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale 
boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. 

“And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” 

Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been 
hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him. 

“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who 
you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red 
hair, freckles, and more children than they can 
afford.” 

He turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some 
wizarding families are much better than others, 

Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the 
wrong sort. I can help you there.” 



Page | 121 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




He held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry 
didn’t take it. 

“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, 
thanks,” he said coolly. 

Draco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared 
in his pale cheeks. 

“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly. 
“Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as 
your parents. They didn’t know what was good for 
them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the 
Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.” 

Both Harry and Ron stood up. 

“Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair. 

“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy 
sneered. 

“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely 
than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot 
bigger than him or Ron. 

“But we don’t feel like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve 
eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.” 

Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to 
Ron — Ron leapt forward, but before he’d so much as 
touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. 

Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp 
little teeth sunk deep into Goyle ’s knuckle — Crabbe 
and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers 
round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally 
flew off and hit the window, all three of them 
disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were 
Page | 122 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps 
they’d heard footsteps, because a second later, 
Hermione Granger had come in. 

“What has been going on?” she said, looking at the 
sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers 
by his tail. 

“I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. 

He looked closer at Scabbers. “No — I don’t believe it 
— he’s gone back to sleep.” 

And so he had. 

“You’ve met Malfoy before?” 

Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. 

“I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were 
some of the first to come back to our side after You- 
Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been bewitched. 
My dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father 
didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.” He 
turned to Hermione. “Can we help you with 
something?” 

“You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve 
just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he 
says we’re nearly there. You haven’t been fighting, 
have you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get 
there!” 

“Scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said Ron, 
scowling at her. “Would you mind leaving while we 
change?” 

“All right — I only came in here because people 
outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and 
down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy voice. 

Page | 123 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you 
know?” 



Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the 
window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains 
and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did 
seem to be slowing down. 

He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their 
long black robes. Ron’s were a bit short for him, you 
could see his sneakers underneath them. 

A voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching 
Hogwarts in five minutes’ time. Please leave your 
luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school 
separately.” 

Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he 
saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed 
their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined 
the crowd thronging the corridor. 

The train slowed right down and finally stopped. 
People pushed their way toward the door and out on 
to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold 
night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads 
of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: 
“Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there, 
Harry?” 

Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. 

“C’mon, follow me — any more firs’ years? Mind yer 
step, now! Firs’ years follow me!” 

Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down 
what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so 
dark on either side of them that Harry thought there 
must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. 

Page | 124 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once 
or twice. 



“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid 
called over his shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.” 

There was a loud “Oooooh!” 

The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge 
of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain 
on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry 
sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. 

“No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, pointing to 
a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. 
Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville 
and Hermione. 

“Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to 
himself. “Right then — FORWARD!” 

And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, 
gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as 
glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great 
castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed 
nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. 

“Heads down!” yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached 
the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats 
carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide 
opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a 
dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right 
underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of 
underground harbor, where they clambered out onto 
rocks and pebbles. 

“Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who 
was checking the boats as people climbed out of 
them. 

Page | 125 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his 
hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the 
rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto 
smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle. 

They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded 
around the huge, oak front door. 

“Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?” 

Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times 
on the castle door.

THE SORTING HAT 

The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired 
witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a 
very stern face and Harry’s first thought was that this 
was not someone to cross. 

“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid. 

“Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.” 

She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so 
big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ 
house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming 
torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too 
high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase 
facing them led to the upper floors. 

They followed Professor McGonagall across the 
flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of 
hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the 
rest of the school must already be here — but 
Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a 
small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, 
Page | 127 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 



standing rather closer together than they would 
usually have done, peering about nervously. 

“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. 
“The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but 
before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will 
be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very 
important ceremony because, while you are here, 
your House will be something like your family within 
Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your 
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free 
time in your House common room. 

“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, 
Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own 
noble history and each has produced outstanding 
witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your 
triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule- 
breaking will lose House points. At the end of the 
year, the House with the most points is awarded the 
House cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a 
credit to whichever House becomes yours. 

“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few 
minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest 
you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can 
while you are waiting.” 

Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, 
which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s 
smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his 
hair. 

“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said 
Professor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.” 

She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. 



Page | 128 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“How exactly do they sort us into Houses?” he asked 
Ron. 



“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but 
I think he was joking.” 

Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of 
the whole school? But he didn’t know any magic yet 
— what on earth would he have to do? He hadn’t 
expected something like this the moment they 
arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that 
everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking 
much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering 
very fast about all the spells she’d learned and 
wondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard not 
to listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, never, 
not even when he’d had to take a school report home 
to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his 
teachers wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. 
Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come 
back and lead him to his doom. 

Then something happened that made him jump about 
a foot in the air — several people behind him 
screamed. 

“What the — ?” 

He gasped. So did the people around him. About 
twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back 
wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they 
glided across the room talking to one another and 
hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be 
arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was 
saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give 
him a second chance — ” 

“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the 
chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and 

Page | 129 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




you know, he’s not really even a ghost — I say, what 
are you all doing here?” 



A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly 
noticed the first years. 

Nobody answered. 

“New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at 
them. “About to be Sorted, I suppose?” 

A few people nodded mutely. 

“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old 
House, you know.” 

“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting 
Ceremony’s about to start.” 

Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the 
ghosts floated away through the opposite wall. 

“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first 
years, “and follow me.” 

Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, 
Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with 
Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, 
back across the hall, and through a pair of double 
doors into the Great Hall. 

Harry had never even imagined such a strange and 
splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands 
of candles that were floating in midair over four long 
tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. 
These tables were laid with glittering golden plates 
and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long 
table where the teachers were sitting. Professor 
McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they 
Page | 130 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




came to a halt in a line facing the other students, 
with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces 
staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the 
flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among 
the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to 
avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and 
saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard 
Hermione whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the sky 
outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.” 

It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, 
and that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the 
heavens. 

Harry quickly looked down again as Professor 
McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front 
of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed 
wizard’s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and 
extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in 
the house. 

Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry 
thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — 
noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at 
the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there 
was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip 
near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the 
hat began to sing: 

“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, 

But don’t judge on what you see, 

I’ll eat myself if you can find 

A smarter hat than me. 

You can keep your bowlers black, 



Page | 131 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Your top hats sleek and tall, 

For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat 
And I can cap them all. 

There’s nothing hidden in your head 
The Sorting Hat can’t see, 

So try me on and I will tell you 
Where you ought to be. 

You might belong in Gryffindor, 

Where dwell the brave at heart, 

Their daring, nerve, and chivalry 
Set Gryffindors apart; 

You might belong in Hufflepuff, 

Where they are just and loyal, 

Those patient Hufflepuffs are true 
And unafraid of toil; 

Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, 

If you’ve a ready mind, 

Where those of wit and learning, 

Will always find their kind; 

Or perhaps in Slytherin 

Page | 132 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




You’ll make your real friends, 

Those cunning folk use any means 
To achieve their ends. 

So put me on! Don’t be afraid l\ 

And don’t get in a flap\ 

You’re in safe hands (though I have none) 

For I’m a Thinking Cap\” 

The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished 
its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then 
became quite still again. 

“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to 
Harry. “I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling 
a troll.” 

Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot 
better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they 
could have tried it on without everyone watching. The 
hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel 
brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If 
only the hat had mentioned a House for people who 
felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for 
him. 

Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a 
long roll of parchment. 

“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and 
sit on the stool to be sorted,” she said. “Abbott, 
Hannah!” 



Page | 133 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of 
line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her 
eyes, and sat down. A moment’s pause — 

“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat. 

The table on the right cheered and clapped as 
Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. 

Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at 
her. 

“Bones, Susan!” 

“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan 
scuttled off to sit next to Hannah. 

“Boot, Terry!” 

“RAVENCLAW!” 

The table second from the left clapped this time; 
several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with 
Terry as he joined them. 

“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but 
“Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, 
and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; 
Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling. 

“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. 
Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d 
heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked 
like an unpleasant lot. 

He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He 
remembered being picked for teams during gym at his 
old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not 
because he was no good, but because no one wanted 
Dudley to think they liked him. 

Page | 134 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!” 



“HUFFLEPUFF!” 

Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the 
House at once, but at others it took a little while to 
decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy 
next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a 
whole minute before the hat declared him a 
Gryffindor. 

“Granger, Hermione!” 

Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat 
eagerly on her head. 

“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned. 

A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts 
always do when you’re very nervous. What if he 
wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with 
the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor 
McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had 
obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on 
the train? 

When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his 
toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. 
The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When 
it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still 
wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter 
to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.” 

Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called 
and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched 
his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” 

Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, 
looking pleased with himself. 

Page | 135 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




There weren’t many people left now. 



“Moon” , “Nott” ... , “Parkinson” ... , then a pair of 
twin girls, “Path” and “Path” ... , then “Perks, Sally- 
Anne” . . . , and then, at last — 

“Potter, Harry!” 

As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke 
out like little hissing fires all over the hall. 

“ Potter , did she say?” 

“ The Harry Potter?” 

The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over 
his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a 
good look at him. Next second he was looking at the 
black inside of the hat. He waited. 

“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very 
difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind 
either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a 
nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. ... 
So where shall I put you?” 

Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not 
Slytherin, not Slytherin. 

“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you 
sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in 
your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to 
greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re 
sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!” 

Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole 
hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward 
the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been 
chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed 

Page | 136 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the 
Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while 
the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got 
Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff 
he’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving 
Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it 
into a bucket of ice-cold water. 

He could see the High Table properly now. At the end 
nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave 
him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, 
in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, 
sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once 
from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on 
the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing 
in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. 
Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous 
young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking 
very peculiar in a large purple turban. 

And now there were only four people left to be sorted. 
“Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, 
joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,” 
became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. He 
was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers 
under the table and a second later the hat had 
shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” 

Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed 
into the chair next to him. 

“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley 
pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was 
made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her 
scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. 

Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had 
only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin 
pasties seemed ages ago. 

Page | 137 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was 
beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if 
nothing could have pleased him more than to see 
them all there. 

“Welcome!” he said. “Welcome to a new year at 
Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like 
to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! 

Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! 

“Thank you!” 

He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. 
Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not. 

“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly. 

“Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard 
in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, 
Harry?” 

Harry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him 
were now piled with food. He had never seen so many 
things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast 
chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, 
bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, 
fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, 
ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint 
humbugs. 

The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but 
he’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. 
Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really 
wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate 
with a bit of everything except the peppermints and 
began to eat. It was all delicious. 

“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, 
watching Harry cut up his steak. 

Page | 138 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Can’t you — ?” 



“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said 
the ghost. “I don’t need to, of course, but one does 
miss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced myself? Sir 
Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. 
Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.” 

“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My 
brothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless 
Nick!” 

“I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy 
— ” the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus 
Finnigan interrupted. 

“Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?” 

Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little 
chat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted. 

“Like this,” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and 
pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell 
onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone 
had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it 
properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on 
their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head 
back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new 
Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the 
House Championship this year? Gryffindors have 
never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have 
got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s 
becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin 
ghost.” 

Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a 
horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a 
gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He 
was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to 

Page | 139 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating 
arrangements. 

“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus 
with great interest. 

“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick 
delicately. 

When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the 
remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving 
them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the 
desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor 
you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate 
eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell- 
0, rice pudding ... 

As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk 
turned to their families. 

“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. 
Mom didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after they 
were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.” 

The others laughed. 

“What about you, Neville?” said Ron. 

“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” 
said Neville, “but the family thought I was all- Muggle 
for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me 
off my guard and force some magic out of me — he 
pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly 
drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. 
Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was 
hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles 
when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue 
and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the 
way down the garden and into the road. They were all 
Page | 140 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 




really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. 
And you should have seen their faces when I got in 
here — they thought I might not be magic enough to 
come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he 
bought me my toad.” 

On Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione 
were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right 
away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly 
interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning 
something into something else, of course, it’s 
supposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting 
small, just matches into needles and that sort of 
thing — ”). 



Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, 
looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was 
drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall 
was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor 
Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a 
teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and 
sallow skin. 

It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher 
looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s 
eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on 
Harry’s forehead. 

“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head. 

“What is it?” asked Percy. 

“N-nothing.” 

The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder 
to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the 
teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at 
all. 



Page | 141 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he 
asked Percy. 

“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder 
he’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He 
teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone 
knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot 
about the Dark Arts, Snape.” 

Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t 
look at him again. 

At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor 
Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. 

“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all 
fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to 
give you. 

“First years should note that the forest on the 
grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our 
older students would do well to remember that as 
well.” 

Dumbledore ’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction 
of the Weasley twins. 

“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to 
remind you all that no magic should be used between 
classes in the corridors. 

“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of 
the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House 
teams should contact Madam Hooch. 

“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third- 
floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds 
to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful 
death.” 

Page | 142 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 




Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. 



“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy. 

“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s 
odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re 
not allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s full of 
dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he 
might have told us prefects, at least.” 

“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school 
song!” cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other 
teachers’ smiles had become rather fixed. 

Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was 
trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden 
ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables 
and twisted itself, snakelike, into words. 

“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, 
“and off we go!” 

And the school bellowed: 

“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, 

Teach us something please, 

Whether we be old and bald 
Or young with scabby knees, 

Our heads could do with filling 
With some interesting stuff, 

For now they’re bare and full of air, 

Dead flies and bits of fluff, 

Page | 143 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 




So teach us things worth knowing, 

Bring back what we’ve forgot, 

Just do your best, we’ll do the rest, 

And learn until our brains all rot.” 

Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, 
only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a 
very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their 
last few lines with his wand and when they had 
finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. 

“Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic 
beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you 
trot!” 

The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the 
chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the 
marble staircase. Harry’s legs were like lead again, 
but only because he was so tired and full of food. He 
was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in 
the portraits along the corridors whispered and 
pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them 
through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and 
hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, 
yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just 
wondering how much farther they had to go when 
they came to a sudden halt. 

A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair 
ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them 
they started throwing themselves at him. 

“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A 
poltergeist.” He raised his voice, “Peeves — show 
yourself.” 



Page | 144 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a 
balloon, answered. 

“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?” 

There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark 
eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- 
legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. 

“Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle 
Firsties! What fun!” 

He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. 

“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I 
mean it!” barked Percy. 

Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping 
the walking sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him 
zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. 

“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as 
they set off again. “The Bloody Baron’s the only one 
who can control him, he won’t even listen to us 
prefects. Here we are.” 

At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a 
very fat woman in a pink silk dress. 

“Password?” she said. 

“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung 
forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all 
scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up — 
and found themselves in the Gryffindor common 
room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. 

Percy directed the girls through one door to their 
dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of 

Page | 145 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 




a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the 
towers — they found their beds at last: five four- 
posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their 
trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk 
much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed. 

“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through 
the hangings. “Get off Scabbers! He’s chewing my 
sheets.” 

Harry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the 
treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. 

Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he 
had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor 
Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling 
him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it 
was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn’t want 
to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried 
to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there 
was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — 
then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, 
Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there 
was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating 
and shaking. 

He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he 
woke next day, he didn’t remember the dream at all. 



Page | 146 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 






THE POTIONS MASTER 

“There, look.” 

“Where?” 

“Next to the tall kid with the red hair.” 

“Wearing the glasses?” 

“Did you see his face?” 

“Did you see his scar?” 

Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his 
dormitory the next day. People lining up outside 
classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or 
doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, 
staring. Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he was 
trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes. 

There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at 
Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; 
some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some 

Page | 147 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 



with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to 
remember to jump. Then there were doors that 
wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled 
them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t 
really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It 
was also very hard to remember where anything was, 
because it all seemed to move around a lot. The 
people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, 
and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. 

The ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty 
shock when one of them glided suddenly through a 
door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick 
was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the 
right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth 
two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him 
when you were late for class. He would drop 
wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from 
under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak 
up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, 
“GOT YOUR CONK!” 

Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the 
caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get 
on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. 
Filch found them trying to force their way through a 
door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to 
the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He 
wouldn’t believe they were lost, was sure they were 
trying to break into it on purpose, and was 
threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they 
were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. 

Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust- 
colored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like 
Filch’s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule 
in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she’d 
whisk off for Filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two 
seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of 
Page | 148 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 




the school better than anyone (except perhaps the 
Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any 
of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was 
the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a 
good kick. 

And then, once you had managed to find them, there 
were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to 
magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your 
wand and saying a few funny words. 

They had to study the night skies through their 
telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn 
the names of different stars and the movements of the 
planets. Three times a week they went out to the 
greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, 
with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, 
where they learned how to take care of all the strange 
plants and fungi, and found out what they were used 
for. 

Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, 
which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor 
Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen 
asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next 
morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns 
droned on and on while they scribbled down names 
and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the 
Oddball mixed up. 

Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny 
little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to 
see over his desk. At the start of their first class he 
took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name 
he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. 

Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had 
been quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to 



Page | 149 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking- to 
the moment they sat down in her first class. 

“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and 
dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” she 
said. “Anyone messing around in my class will leave 
and not come back. You have been warned.” 

Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. 
They were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get 
started, but soon realized they weren’t going to be 
changing the furniture into animals for a long time. 
After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each 
given a match and started trying to turn it into a 
needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione 
Granger had made any difference to her match; 
Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had 
gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare 
smile. 

The class everyone had really been looking forward to 
was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s 
lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom 
smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to 
ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was 
afraid would be coming back to get him one of these 
days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him 
by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of 
a troublesome zombie, but they weren’t sure they 
believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus 
Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had 
fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started 
talking about the weather; for another, they had 
noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, 
and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full 
of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected 
wherever he went. 



Page | 150 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t 
miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come 
from Muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had any 
idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so 
much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have 
much of a head start. 

Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They 
finally managed to find their way down to the Great 
Hall for breakfast without getting lost once. 

“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he 
poured sugar on his porridge. 

“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. 
“Snape’s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always 
favors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” 

“Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor 
McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it 
hadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of 
homework the day before. 

Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to 
this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on 
the first morning, when about a hundred owls had 
suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during 
breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their 
owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their 
laps. 

Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. She 
sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of 
toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the 
other school owls. This morning, however, she 
fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar 
bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate. Harry 
tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: 



Page | 151 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Dear Harry, 



I know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like 
to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? 

I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an 
answer back with Hedwig. 

Hagrid 

Harry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see 
you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off 
again. 

It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look 
forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to 
be the worst thing that had happened to him so far. 

At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the 
idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of 
the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong. 
Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him. 

Potions lessons took place down in one of the 
dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main 
castle, and would have been quite creepy enough 
without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all 
around the walls. 

Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the 
roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name. 

“Ah, yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — 
celebrity.” 

Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle 
sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling 
the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were 
black like Hagrid ’s, but they had none of Hagrid ’s 

Page | 152 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




warmth. They were cold and empty and made you 
think of dark tunnels. 

“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art 
of potion-making,” he began. He spoke in barely more 
than a whisper, but they caught every word — like 
Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a 
class silent without effort. “As there is little foolish 
wand- waving here, many of you will hardly believe 
this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand 
the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its 
shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that 
creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, 
ensnaring the senses. ... I can teach you how to bottle 
fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t 
as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to 
teach.” 

More silence followed this little speech. Harry and 
Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione 
Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked 
desperate to start proving that she wasn’t a 
dunderhead. 

“Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I 
added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of 
wormwood?” 

Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry 
glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; 
Hermione ’s hand had shot into the air. 

“I don’t know, sir,” said Harry. 

Snape ’s lips curled into a sneer. 

“Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.” 

He ignored Hermione ’s hand. 

Page | 153 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told 
you to find me a bezoar?” 

Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it 
would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry 
didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He 
tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who 
were shaking with laughter. 

“I don’t know, sir.” 

“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, 
eh, Potter?” 

Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into 
those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at 
the Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to remember 
everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and 
Fungi ? 

Snape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand. 

“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood 
and wolfsbane?” 

At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching 
toward the dungeon ceiling. 

“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione 
does, though, why don’t you try her?” 

A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, 
and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not 
pleased. 

“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your 
information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a 
sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the 
Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken 

Page | 154 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from 
most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they 
are the same plant, which also goes by the name of 
aconite. Well? Why aren’t you all copying that down?” 

There was a sudden rummaging for quills and 
parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, “And a point 
will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, 
Potter.” 

Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the 
Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into 
pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to 
cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, 
watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake 
fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, 
whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone 
to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his 
horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a 
loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow 
managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted 
blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone 
floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within 
seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools 
while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion 
when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as 
angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. 

“Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion 
away with one wave of his wand. “I suppose you 
added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron 
off the fire?” 

Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over 
his nose. 

“Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at 
Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who 
had been working next to Neville. 

Page | 155 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add 
the quills? Thought he’d make you look good if he got 
it wrong, did you? That’s another point you’ve lost for 
Gryffindor.” 

This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to 
argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. 

“Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can 
turn very nasty.” 

As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour 
later, Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were 
low. He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very 
first week — why did Snape hate him so much? 

“Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape’s always taking points 
off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid 
with you?” 

At five to three they left the castle and made their way 
across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden 
house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow 
and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. 

When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling 
from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid ’s 
voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” 

Hagrid ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he 
pulled the door open. 

“Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.” 

He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar 
of an enormous black boarhound. 

There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants 
were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was 

Page | 156 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a 
massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. 

“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of 
Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started 
licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as 
fierce as he looked. 

“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring 
boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock 
cakes onto a plate. 

“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s 
freckles. “I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers 
away from the forest.” 

The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins 
that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron 
pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all 
about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on 
Harry’s knee and drooled all over his robes. 

Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call 
Filch “that old git.” 

“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce 
her to Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up 
ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can’t get 
rid of her — Filch puts her up to it.” 

Harry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like 
Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape 
liked hardly any of the students. 

“But he seemed to really hate me.” 

“Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?” 



Page | 157 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t 
quite meet his eyes when he said that. 

“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I 
liked him a lot — great with animals.” 

Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on 
purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s 
work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper 
that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was 
a cutting from the Daily Prophet : 

GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST 

Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts 
on 3 1 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark 
wizards or witches unknown. 

Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had 
been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact 
been emptied the same day. 

“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep 
your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said 
a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. 

Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that 
someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t 
mentioned the date. 

“Hagrid!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in 
happened on my birthday! It might’ve been happening 
while we were there!” 

There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn’t 
meet Harry’s eyes this time. He grunted and offered 
him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. 

The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied 
earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven 
Page | 158 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, 
taking out that grubby little package. Had that been 
what the thieves were looking for? 

As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for 
dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes 
they’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that 
none of the lessons he’d had so far had given him as 
much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid 
collected that package just in time? Where was it 
now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape 
that he didn’t want to tell Harry?

THE MIDNIGHT DUEL 

Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he 
hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met 
Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had 
Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put 
up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn’t until 
they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor 
common room that made them all groan. Flying 
lessons would be starting on Thursday — and 
Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. 

“Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always 
wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in 
front of Malfoy.” 

He had been looking forward to learning to fly more 
than anything else. 

“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” 
said Ron reasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always 
going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet 
that’s all talk.” 

Page | 160 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 



Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He 
complained loudly about first years never getting on 
the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful 
stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly 
escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn’t the only 
one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he’d 
spent most of his childhood zooming around the 
countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell 
anyone who’d listen about the time he’d almost hit a 
hang glider on Charlie’s old broom. Everyone from 
wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. 
Ron had already had a big argument with Dean 
Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. 
Ron couldn’t see what was exciting about a game with 
only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry 
had caught Ron prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham 
soccer team, trying to make the players move. 

Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, 
because his grandmother had never let him near one. 
Privately, Harry felt she’d had good reason, because 
Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of 
accidents even with both feet on the ground. 

Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about 
flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn’t 
learn by heart out of a book — not that she hadn’t 
tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all 
stupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library 
book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was 
hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything 
that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, 
but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ’s 
lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. 

Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, 
something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of 
course. Malfoy ’s eagle owl was always bringing him 



Page | 161 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




packages of sweets from home, which he opened 
gloatingly at the Slytherin table. 

A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his 
grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed 
them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which 
seemed to be full of white smoke. 

“It’s a Remembrall!” he explained. “Gran knows I 
forget things — this tells you if there’s something 
you’ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this 
and if it turns red — oh ...” His face fell, because the 
Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “... you’ve 
forgotten something ...” 

Neville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten 
when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor 
table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand. 

Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half 
hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor 
McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any 
teacher in the school, was there in a flash. 

“What’s going on?” 

“Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.” 

Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall 
back on the table. 

“Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with 
Crabbe and Goyle behind him. 

At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the 
other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto 
the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, 
breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as 
they marched down the sloping lawns toward a 
Page | 162 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds 
to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying 
darkly in the distance. 

The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty 
broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry 
had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about 
the school brooms, saying that some of them started 
to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly 
to the left. 

Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, 
gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. 

“Well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked. 
“Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry 
up.” " 

Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and 
some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles. 

“Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called 
Madam Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!’ ” 

“UP!” everyone shouted. 

Harry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it 
was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger’s had 
simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville’s hadn’t 
moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell 
when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a 
quaver in Neville’s voice that said only too clearly that 
he wanted to keep his feet on the ground. 

Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their 
brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up 
and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and 
Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he’d been 
doing it wrong for years. 

Page | 163 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the 
ground, hard,” said Madam Hooch. “Keep your 
brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight 
back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle 
— three — two — ” 

But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of 
being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the 
whistle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips. 

“Come back, boy!” she shouted, but Neville was rising 
straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve 
feet — twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face 
look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, 
slip sideways off the broom and — 

WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay 
facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was 
still rising higher and higher, and started to drift 
lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight. 

Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as 
white as his. 

“Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter. “Come on, 
boy — it’s all right, up you get.” 

She turned to the rest of the class. 

“None of you is to move while I take this boy to the 
hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are 
or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 
‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” 

Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, 
hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm 
around him. 



Page | 164 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst 
into laughter. 

“Did you see his face, the great lump?” 

The other Slytherins joined in. 

“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil. 

“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy 
Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. “Never thought 
you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.” 

“Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching 
something out of the grass. “It’s that stupid thing 
Longbottom’s gran sent him.” 

The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. 

“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone 
stopped talking to watch. 

Malfoy smiled nastily. 

“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find 
— how about — up a tree?” 

“Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto 
his broomstick and taken off. He hadn’t been lying, he 
could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost 
branches of an oak he called, “Come and get it, 
Potter!” 

Harry grabbed his broom. 

“iVo!” shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told 
us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.” 



Page | 165 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. 

He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the 
ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his 
hair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in 
a rush of fierce joy he realized he’d found something 
he could do without being taught — this was easy, 
this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a 
little to take it even higher, and heard screams and 
gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring 
whoop from Ron. 

He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in 
midair. Malfoy looked stunned. 

“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that 
broom!” 

“Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking 
worried. 

Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward 
and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it 
shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got 
out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about- 
face and held the broom steady. A few people below 
were clapping. 

“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, 
Malfoy,” Harry called. 

The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. 

“Catch it if you can, then!” he shouted, and he threw 
the glass ball high into the air and streaked back 
toward the ground. 

Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up 
in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward 
and pointed his broom handle down — next second 

Page | 166 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball 
— wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the 
screams of people watching — he stretched out his 
hand — a foot from the ground he caught it, just in 
time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently 
onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in 
his fist. 

“HARRY POTTER!” 

His heart sank faster than he’d just dived. Professor 
McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his 
feet, trembling. 

“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” 

Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with 
shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare 
you — might have broken your neck — ” 

“It wasn’t his fault, Professor — ” 

“Be quiet, Miss Patil — ” 

“But Malfoy — ” 

“That’s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.” 

Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s 
triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in 
Professor McGonagall’s wake as she strode toward the 
castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. 

He wanted to say something to defend himself, but 
there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. 
Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without 
even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now 
he’d done it. He hadn’t even lasted two weeks. He’d be 
packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the 
Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? 
Page | 167 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, 
and still Professor McGonagall didn’t say a word to 
him. She wrenched open doors and marched along 
corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. 
Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He 
thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as 
gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid’s assistant. 
His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron 
and the others becoming wizards while he stumped 
around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag. 

Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. 
She opened the door and poked her head inside. 

“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood 
for a moment?” 

Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane 
she was going to use on him? 

But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year 
boy who came out of Flitwick’s class looking 
confused. 

“Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and 
they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking 
curiously at Harry. 

“In here.” 

Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom 
that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy 
writing rude words on the blackboard. 

“Out, Peeves!” she barked. Peeves threw the chalk 
into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out 
cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door 
behind him and turned to face the two boys. 



Page | 168 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I’ve found you a 
Seeker.” 

Wood’s expression changed from puzzlement to 
delight. 

“Are you serious, Professor?” 

“Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “The 
boy’s a natural. I’ve never seen anything like it. Was 
that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?” 

Harry nodded silently. He didn’t have a clue what was 
going on, but he didn’t seem to be being expelled, and 
some of the feeling started coming back to his legs. 

“He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot 
dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even 
scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done 
it.” 

Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had 
come true at once. 

“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked 
excitedly. 

“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor 
McGonagall explained. 

“He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now 
walking around Harry and staring at him. “Light — 
speedy — we’ll have to get him a decent broom, 
Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a 
Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.” 

“I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we 
can’t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need 
a better team than last year. Flattened in that last 

Page | 169 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in 
the face for weeks. ...” 

Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses 
at Harry. 

“I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may 
change my mind about punishing you.” 

Then she suddenly smiled. 

“Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He 
was an excellent Quidditch player himself.” 

“You’re joking.” 

It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron 
what had happened when he’d left the grounds with 
Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and 
kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all 
about it. 

“Seeker?” he said. “But first years never — you must 
be the youngest House player in about — ” 

“ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his 
mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the 
excitement of the afternoon. “Wood told me.” 

Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and 
gaped at Harry. 

“I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t 
tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.” 

Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, 
spotted Harry, and hurried over. 



Page | 170 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us. 
We’re on the team too — Beaters.” 

“I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for 
sure this year,” said Fred. “We haven’t won since 
Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be 
brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost 
skipping when he told us.” 

“Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s 
found a new secret passageway out of the school.” 

“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the 
Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.” 

Fred and George had hardly disappeared when 
someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked 
by Crabbe and Goyle. 

“Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the 
train back to the Muggles?” 

“You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the 
ground and you’ve got your little friends with you,” 
said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all 
little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table 
was full of teachers, neither of them could do more 
than crack their knuckles and scowl. 

“I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. 
“Tonight, if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — 
no contact. What’s the matter? Never heard of a 
wizard’s duel before, I suppose?” 

“Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m 
his second, who’s yours?” 

Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up. 



Page | 171 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? Well meet you 
in the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.” 

When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each 
other. 

“What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do 
you mean, you’re my second?” 

“Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said 
Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. 
Catching the look on Harry’s face, he added quickly, 
“But people only die in proper duels, you know, with 
real wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do 
is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows 
enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he 
expected you to refuse, anyway.” 

“And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?” 

“Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron 
suggested. 

“Excuse me.” 

They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. 

“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron. 

Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. 

“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy 
were saying — ” 

“Bet you could,” Ron muttered. 

“ — and you mustn’t go wandering around the school 
at night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if 



Page | 172 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




you’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s really very 
selfish of you.” 

“And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry. 
“Good-bye,” said Ron. 

All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end 
to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later 
listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville 
wasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent 
all evening giving him advice such as “If he tries to 
curse you, you’d better dodge it, because I can’t 
remember how to block them.” There was a very good 
chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. 
Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, 
breaking another school rule today. On the other 
hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of 
the darkness — this was his big chance to beat 
Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn’t miss it. 

“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better 
go.” 

They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their 
wands, and crept across the tower room, down the 
spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common 
room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, 
turning all the armchairs into hunched black 
shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole 
when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, “I 
can’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry.” 

A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, 
wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. 

“You!” said Ron furiously. “Go back to bed!” 



Page | 173 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, 

“Percy — he’s a prefect, he’d put a stop to this.” 

Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering. 

“Come on,” he said to Ron. He pushed open the 
portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole. 

Hermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. She 
followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at 
them like an angry goose. 

“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care 
about yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the 
House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from 
Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching 
Spells.” 

“Go away.” 

“All right, but I warned you, you just remember what 
I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, 
you’re so — ” 

But what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermione 
had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back 
inside and found herself facing an empty painting. 

The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and 
Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower. 

“Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly. 

“That’s your problem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go, 
we’re going to be late.” 

They hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor 
when Hermione caught up with them. 

“I’m coming with you,” she said. 

Page | 174 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“You are not.” 



“D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for 
Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell 
him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you 
can back me up.” 

“You’ve got some nerve — ” said Ron loudly. 

“Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. “I heard 
something.” 

It was a sort of snuffling. 

“Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the 
dark. 

It wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up 
on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake 
as they crept nearer. 

“Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for 
hours, I couldn’t remember the new password to get 
in to bed.” 

“Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig 
snout’ but it won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone 
off somewhere.” 

“How’s your arm?” said Harry. 

“Fine,” said Neville, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey 
mended it in about a minute.” 

“Good — well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be 
somewhere, we’ll see you later — ” 



Page | 175 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Don’t leave me!” said Neville, scrambling to his feet, 

“I don’t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s 
been past twice already.” 

Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at 
Hermione and Neville. 

“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve 
learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us 
about, and used it on you.” 

Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron 
exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry 
hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all 
forward. 

They flitted along corridors striped with bars of 
moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry 
expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they 
were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor 
and tiptoed toward the trophy room. 

Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal 
trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught 
them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver 
and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, 
keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the 
room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in 
and started at once. The minutes crept by. 

“He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered. 

Then a noise in the next room made them jump. 

Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard 
someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy. 

“Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a 
corner.” 



Page | 176 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, 
Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as 
quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the 
door, away from Filch’s voice. Neville’s robes had 
barely whipped round the corner when they heard 
Filch enter the trophy room. 

“They’re in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter, 
“probably hiding.” 

“This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, 
petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full 
of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting 
nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak 
and broke into a run — he tripped, grabbed Ron 
around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right 
into a suit of armor. 

The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the 
whole castle. 

“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted 
down the gallery, not looking back to see whether 
Filch was following — they swung around the 
doorpost and galloped down one corridor then 
another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where 
they were or where they were going — they ripped 
through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden 
passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their 
Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from 
the trophy room. 

“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against 
the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was 
bent double, wheezing and spluttering. 

“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the 
stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” 



Page | 177 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, 
“quickly as possible.” 

“Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry. “You 
realize that, don’t you? He was never going to meet 
you — Filch knew someone was going to be in the 
trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.” 

Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t 
going to tell her that. 

“Let’s go.” 

It wasn’t going to be that simple. They hadn’t gone 
more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled 
and something came shooting out of a classroom in 
front of them. 

It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a 
squeal of delight. 

“Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown 
out.” 

Peeves cackled. 

“Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, 
tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.” 

“Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.” 

“Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a sanity 
voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. “It’s for your 
own good, you know.” 

“Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at 
Peeves — this was a big mistake. 



Page | 178 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed, 
“STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS 
CORRIDOR!” 

Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right 
to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a 
door — and it was locked. 

“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at 
the door, “We’re done for! This is the end!” 

They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he 
could toward Peeves ’s shouts. 

“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed 
Harry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, 
“Alohomora\” 

The lock clicked and the door swung open — they 
piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their 
ears against it, listening. 

“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. 
“Quick, tell me.” 

“Say ‘please.’ ” 

“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?” 

“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said 
Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. 

“All right — please.” 

“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing 
if you didn’t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they 
heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch 
cursing in rage. 



Page | 179 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“He thinks this door is locked,” Harry whispered. “I 
think well be okay — get off Neville!” For Neville had 
been tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the 
last minute. “What?” 

Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. 
For a moment, he was sure he’d walked into a 
nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything 
that had happened so far. 

They weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They 
were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third 
floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden. 

They were looking straight into the eyes of a 
monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space 
between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three 
pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and 
quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, 
saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. 

It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, 
and Harry knew that the only reason they weren’t 
already dead was that their sudden appearance had 
taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over 
that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous 
growls meant. 

Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and 
death, he’d take Filch. 

They fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, 
and they ran, they almost flew, back down the 
corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them 
somewhere else, because they didn’t see him 
anywhere, but they hardly cared — all they wanted to 
do was put as much space as possible between them 
and that monster. They didn’t stop running until they 



Page | 180 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh 
floor. 

“Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, 
looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders 
and their flushed, sweaty faces. 

“Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted 
Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They 
scrambled into the common room and collapsed, 
trembling, into armchairs. 

It was a while before any of them said anything. 
Neville, indeed, looked as if he’d never speak again. 

“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing 
like that locked up in a school?” said Ron finally. “If 
any dog needs exercise, that one does.” 

Hermione had got both her breath and her bad 
temper back again. 

“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she 
snapped. “Didn’t you see what it was standing on?” 

“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its 
feet, I was too busy with its heads.” 

“No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s 
obviously guarding something.” 

She stood up, glaring at them. 

“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all 
have been killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you 
don’t mind, I’m going to bed.” 

Ron stared after her, his mouth open. 



Page | 181 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged 
her along, wouldn’t you?” 

But Hermione had given Harry something else to 
think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was 
guarding something. . . . What had Hagrid said? 
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for 
something you wanted to hide — except perhaps 
Hogwarts. 

It looked as though Harry had found out where the 
grubby little package from vault seven hundred and 
thirteen was.

HALLOWEEN 

Malfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that 
Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, 
looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the 
next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting 
the three-headed dog had been an excellent 
adventure, and they were quite keen to have another 
one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the 
package that seemed to have been moved from 
Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time 
wondering what could possibly need such heavy 
protection. 

“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said 
Ron. 

“Or both,” said Harry. 

But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious 
object was that it was about two inches long, they 
didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was 
without further clues. 

Page | 183 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 



Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest 
interest in what lay underneath the dog and the 
trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near 
the dog again. 

Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and 
Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they 
saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted 
now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their 
great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail 
about a week later. 

As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, 
everyone’s attention was caught at once by a long, 
thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry 
was just as interested as everyone else to see what 
was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the 
owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, 
knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly 
fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a 
letter on top of the parcel. 

Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, 
because it said: 



DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. 

It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I 
don’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a 
broomstick or they’ll all want one. Oliver Wood will 
meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven 
o’clock for your first training session. 

Professor M. McGonagall 

Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the 
note to Ron to read. 

Page | 184 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously. 
“I’ve never even touched one.” 

They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the 
broomstick in private before their first class, but 
halfway across the entrance hall they found the way 
upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized 
the package from Harry and felt it. 

“That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to 
Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. 
“You’ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren’t 
allowed them.” 

Ron couldn’t resist it. 

“It’s not any old broomstick,” he said, “it’s a Nimbus 
Two Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home, 
Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron grinned at Harry. 
“Comets look flashy, but they’re not in the same 
league as the Nimbus.” 

“What would you know about it, Weasley, you 
couldn’t afford half the handle,” Malfoy snapped back. 
“I suppose you and your brothers have to save up 
twig by twig.” 

Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared 
at Malfoy’s elbow. 

“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked. 

“Potters been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said 
Malfoy quickly. 

“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, 
beaming at Harry. “Professor McGonagall told me all 
about the special circumstances, Potter. And what 
model is it?” 

Page | 185 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting 
not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face. 
“And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I’ve got it,” 
he added. 

Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their 
laughter at Malfoy’s obvious rage and confusion. 

“Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the 
top of the marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen 
Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team. ...” 

“So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking 
rules?” came an angry voice from just behind them. 
Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking 
disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand. 

“I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry. 

“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so 
much good.” 

Hermione marched away with her nose in the air. 

Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his 
lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the 
dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under 
his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where 
he’d be learning to play that night. He bolted his 
dinner that evening without noticing what he was 
eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap 
the Nimbus Two Thousand at last. 

“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto 
Harry’s bedspread. 

Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different 
brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and 
shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of 

Page | 186 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand 
written in gold near the top. 

As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and 
set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He’d 
never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of 
seats were raised in stands around the field so that 
the spectators were high enough to see what was 
going on. At either end of the field were three golden 
poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of 
the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles 
through, except that they were fifty feet high. 

Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry 
mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the 
ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of 
the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. 
The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he 
wanted at his lightest touch. 

“Hey, Potter, come down!” 

Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large 
wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to 
him. 

“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what 
McGonagall meant ... you really are a natural. I’m 
just going to teach you the rules this evening, then 
you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.” 

He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized 
balls. 

“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to 
understand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are 
seven players on each side. Three of them are called 
Chasers.” 



Page | 187 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a 
bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. 

“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Wood. “The 
Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and 
get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten 
points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the 
hoops. Follow me?” 

“The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through 
the hoops to score,” Harry recited. “So — that’s sort of 
like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t 
it?” 



“What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously. 

“Never mind,” said Harry quickly. 

“Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called 
the Keeper — I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly 
around our hoops and stop the other team from 
scoring.” 

“Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was 
determined to remember it all. “And they play with 
the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?” He 
pointed at the three balls left inside the box. 

“I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.” 

He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short 
baseball bat. 

“I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood 
said. “These two are the Bludgers.” 

He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and 
slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed 



Page | 188 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps 
holding them inside the box. 

“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and 
freed one of the Bludgers. 

At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then 
pelted straight at Harry’s face. Harry swung at it with 
the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it 
zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their 
heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it 
and managed to pin it to the ground. 

“See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger 
back into the crate and strapping it down safely. “The 
Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off 
their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on 
each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their 
job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and 
knock them toward the other team. So — think you’ve 
got all that?” 

“Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the 
Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the 
Bludgers away from their team,” Harry reeled off. 

“Very good,” said Wood. 

“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry 
asked, hoping he sounded offhand. 

“Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken 
jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last 
member of the team is the Seeker. That’s you. And 
you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the 
Bludgers — ” 

“ — unless they crack my head open.” 



Page | 189 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for 
the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of human 
Bludgers themselves.” 

Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth 
and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the 
Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. 
It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver 
wings. 

“This,” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the 
most important ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch 
because it’s so fast and difficult to see. It’s the 
Seeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave in and out 
of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get 
it before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever 
Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra 
hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. 
That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of 
Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it 
can go on for ages — I think the record is three 
months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so 
the players could get some sleep. 

“Well, that’s it — any questions?” 

Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to 
do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the 
problem. 

“We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood, 
carefully shutting it back inside the crate, “it’s too 
dark, we might lose it. Let’s try you out with a few of 
these.” 

He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket 
and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the 
air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could 
in every direction for Harry to catch. 

Page | 190 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was 
delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen 
and they couldn’t carry on. 

“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” 
said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the 
castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better 
than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for 
England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.” 

Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what 
with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top 
of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it 
when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts 
two months. The castle felt more like home than 
Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming 
more and more interesting now that they had 
mastered the basics. 

On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious 
smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the 
corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced 
in Charms that he thought they were ready to start 
making objects fly, something they had all been dying 
to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom 
around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the 
class into pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was 
Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville 
had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was 
to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to 
tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. 
She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day 
Harry’s broomstick had arrived. 

“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve 
been practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, 
perched on top of his pile of books as usual. “Swish 
and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the 
magic words properly is very important, too — never 
Page | 191 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’ instead of ‘f and 
found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his 
chest.” 

It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and 
flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be 
sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got 
so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set 
fire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat. 

Ron, at the next table, wasn’t having much more 
luck. 

“Wingardium Leviosal” he shouted, waving his long 
arms like a windmill. 

“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. 
“It’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and 
long.” 

“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled. 

Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked 
her wand, and said, “Wingardium LeviosaV’ 

Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four 
feet above their heads. 

“Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. 
“Everyone see here, Miss Granger’s done it!” 

Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. 

“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to 
Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded 
corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.”

Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past 
him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her 
face — and was startled to see that she was in tears. 

“I think she heard you.” 

“So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. 
“She must’ve noticed she’s got no friends.” 

Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t 
seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great 
Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard 
Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione 
was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be 
left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but 
a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, 
where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of 
their minds. 

A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and 
ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the 
tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the 
pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on 
the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term 
banquet. 

Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato 
when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, 
his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone 
stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, 
slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in 
the dungeons — thought you ought to know.” 

He then sank to the floor in a dead faint. 

There was an uproar. It took several purple 
firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor 
Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence. 



Page | 193 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the 
dormitories immediately!” 

Percy was in his element. 

“Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear 
the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind 
me, now. Make way, first years coming through! 
Excuse me, I’m a prefect!” 

“How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they 
climbed the stairs. 

“Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” 
said Ron. “Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween 
joke.” 

They passed different groups of people hurrying in 
different directions. As they jostled their way through 
a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly 
grabbed Ron’s arm. 

“I’ve just thought — Hermione.” 

“What about her?” 

“She doesn’t know about the troll.” 

Ron bit his lip. 

“Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy’d better not 
see us.” 

Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the 
other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and 
hurried off toward the girls’ bathroom. They had just 
turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps 
behind them. 



Page | 194 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large 
stone griffin. 

Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but 
Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from 
view. 

“What’s he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t he 
down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?” 

“Search me.” 

Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor 
after Snape ’s fading footsteps. 

“He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron 
held up his hand. 

“Can you smell something?” 

Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a 
mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no 
one seems to clean. 

And then they heard it — a low grunting, and the 
shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed — at 
the end of a passage to the left, something huge was 
moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows 
and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. 

It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a 
dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder 
with its small bald head perched on top like a 
coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with 
flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was 
incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which 
dragged along the floor because its arms were so long. 



Page | 195 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. 
It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then 
slouched slowly into the room. 

“The key’s in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could 
lock it in.” 

“Good idea,” said Ron nervously. 

They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, 
praying the troll wasn’t about to come out of it. With 
one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam 
the door, and lock it. 

“Yes!” 

Flushed with their victory, they started to run back 
up the passage, but as they reached the corner they 
heard something that made their hearts stop — a 
high, petrified scream — and it was coming from the 
chamber they’d just chained up. 

“Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. 

“It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped. 

“ Hermionel” they said together. 

It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what 
choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted 
back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their 
panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran 
inside. 

Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall 
opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll 
was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the 
walls as it went. 



Page | 196 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Ron, and, 
seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against 
the wall. 

The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It 
lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had 
made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It 
hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club 
as it went. 

“Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Ron from the other side of the 
chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll 
didn’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its 
shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, 
turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving 
Harry time to run around it. 

“Come on, run, run\” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying 
to pull her toward the door, but she couldn’t move, 
she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open 
with terror. 

The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the 
troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, 
who was nearest and had no way to escape. 

Harry then did something that was both very brave 
and very stupid: He took a great running jump and 
managed to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck 
from behind. The troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging 
there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit 
of wood up its nose, and Harry’s wand had still been 
in his hand when he’d jumped — it had gone straight 
up one of the troll’s nostrils. 

Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its 
club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, 
the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a 
terrible blow with the club. 

Page | 197 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled 
out his own wand — not knowing what he was going 
to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came 
into his head: “Wingardium Leviosal” 

The club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose 
high, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and 
dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner’s 
head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat 
on its face, with a thud that made the whole room 
tremble. 

Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of 
breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still 
raised, staring at what he had done. 

It was Hermione who spoke first. 

“Is it — dead?” 

“I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been 
knocked out.” 

He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s 
nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray 
glue. 

“Urgh — troll boogers.” 

He wiped it on the troll’s trousers. 

A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the 
three of them look up. They hadn’t realized what a 
racket they had been making, but of course, someone 
downstairs must have heard the crashes and the 
troll’s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall 
had come bursting into the room, closely followed by 
Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell 



Page | 198 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and 
sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. 

Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was 
looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her 
look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning 
fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s 
mind. 

“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor 
McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked 
at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the 
air. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you 
in your dormitory?” 

Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked 
at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down. 

Then a small voice came out of the shadows. 

“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for 
me.” 

“Miss Granger!” 

Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last. 

“I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I 
could deal with it on my own — you know, because 
I’ve read all about them.” 

Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a 
downright lie to a teacher? 

“If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry 
stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out 
with its own club. They didn’t have time to come and 
fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they 
arrived.” 

Page | 199 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story 
wasn’t new to them. 

“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, 
staring at the three of them, “Miss Granger, you 
foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a 
mountain troll on your own?” 

Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. 
Hermione was the last person to do anything against 
the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to 
get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started 
handing out sweets. 

“Miss Granger, five points will be taken from 
Gryffindor for this,” said Professor McGonagall. “I’m 
very disappointed in you. If you’re not hurt at all, 
you’d better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are 
finishing the feast in their Houses.” 

Hermione left. 

Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron. 

“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first 
years could have taken on a full-grown mountain 
troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor 
Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.” 

They hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at 
all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief 
to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from 
anything else. 

“We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron 
grumbled. 

“Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione ’s.” 



Page | 200 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” Ron 
admitted. “Mind you, we did save her.” 

“She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t 
locked the thing in with her,” Harry reminded him. 

They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. 

“Pig snout,” they said and entered. 

The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone 
was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, 
however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. 
There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of 
them looking at each other, they all said “Thanks,” 
and hurried off to get plates. 

But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became 
their friend. There are some things you can’t share 
without ending up liking each other, and knocking 
out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.

QUIDDITCH 

As they entered November, the weather turned very 
cold. The mountains around the school became icy 
gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the 
ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen 
from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on 
the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin 
overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin 
boots. 

The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry 
would be playing in his first match after weeks of 
training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor 
won, they would move up into second place in the 
House Championship. 

Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood 
had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry 
should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was 
playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry 
didn’t know which was worse — people telling him 
he’d be brilliant or people telling him they’d be 
running around underneath him holding a mattress. 
Page | 202 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a 
friend. He didn’t know how he’d have gotten through 
all his homework without her, what with all the last- 
minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them 
do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, 
which turned out to be a very interesting read. 

Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of 
committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had 
happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that 
Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, 
and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to 
happen to them; that although people rarely died 
playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish 
and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert. 

Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about 
breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her 
from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for 
it. The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the 
three of them were out in the freezing courtyard 
during break, and she had conjured them up a bright 
blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. 
They were standing with their backs to it, getting 
warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at 
once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from 
view; they were sure it wouldn’t be allowed. 
Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces 
caught Snape’s eye. He limped over. He hadn’t seen 
the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to 
tell them off anyway. 

“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?” 

It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him. 



Page | 203 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Library books are not to be taken outside the 
school,” said Snape. “Give it to me. Five points from 
Gryffindor.” 

“He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily 
as Snape limped away. “Wonder what’s wrong with 
his leg?” 

“Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting him,” said Ron 
bitterly. 

The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that 
evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next 
to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s 
Charms homework for them. She would never let 
them copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking her 
to read it through, they got the right answers anyway. 

Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the 
Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about 
tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting 
up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask 
Snape if he could have it. 

“Better you than me,” they said together, but Harry 
had an idea that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were 
other teachers listening. 

He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. 
There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing. 

Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was 
worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered 
inside — and a horrible scene met his eyes. 

Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was 
holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was 
bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape 
bandages. 

Page | 204 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Blasted thing,” Snape was saying. “How are you 
supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at 
once?” 

Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but — 

“POTTER!” 

Snape ’s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his 
robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped. 

“I just wondered if I could have my book back.” 

“GET OUT! OUT!” 

Harry left, before Snape could take any more points 
from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs. 

“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them. 
“What’s the matter?” 

In a low whisper, Harry told them what he’d seen. 

“You know what this means?” he finished 
breathlessly. “He tried to get past that three-headed 
dog at Halloween! That’s where he was going when we 
saw him — he’s after whatever it’s guarding! And I’d 
bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a 
diversion!” 

Hermione’s eyes were wide. 

“No — he wouldn’t,” she said. “I know he’s not very 
nice, but he wouldn’t try and steal something 
Dumbledore was keeping safe.” 

“Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints 
or something,” snapped Ron. “I’m with Harry. I 



Page | 205 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




wouldn’t put anything past Snape. But what’s he 
after? What’s that dog guarding?” 

Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the 
same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry 
couldn’t sleep. He tried to empty his mind — he 
needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch 
match in a few hours — but the expression on 
Snape’s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn’t easy 
to forget. 

The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The 
Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried 
sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking 
forward to a good Quidditch match. 

“You’ve got to eat some breakfast.” 

“I don’t want anything.” 

“Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione. 

“I’m not hungry.” 

Harry felt terrible. In an hour’s time he’d be walking 
onto the field. 

“Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus 
Finnigan. “Seekers are always the ones who get 
clobbered by the other team.” 

“Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile 
ketchup on his sausages. 

By eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out 
in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many 
students had binoculars. The seats might be raised 
high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what 
was going on sometimes. 

Page | 206 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean 
the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for 
Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the 
sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for 
President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had 
done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then 
Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that 
the paint flashed different colors. 

Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of 
the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch 
robes (Slytherin would be playing in green) . 

Wood cleared his throat for silence. 

“Okay, men,” he said. 

“And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson. 

“And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.” 

“The big one,” said Fred Weasley. 

“The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George. 

“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, 
“we were on the team last year.” 

“Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team 
Gryffindor’s had in years. We’re going to win. I know 
it.” 

He glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.” 

“Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.” 

Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker 
room and, hoping his knees weren’t going to give way, 
walked onto the field to loud cheers. 

Page | 207 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the 
middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her 
broom in her hand. 

“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said, 
once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed 
that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the 
Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year. Harry 
thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in 
him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering 
banner high above, flashing Potter for President over 
the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver. 

“Mount your brooms, please.” 

Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand. 

Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. 

Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They 
were off. 

“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina 
Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser 
that girl is, and rather attractive, too — ” 

“JORDAN!” 

“Sorry, Professor.” 

The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the 
commentary for the match, closely watched by 
Professor McGonagall. 

“And she’s really belting along up there, a neat pass 
to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last 
year only a reserve — back to Johnson and — no, the 
Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain 
Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes — Flint 
Page | 208 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




flying like an eagle up there — he’s going to sc- no, 
stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper 
Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s 
Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive 
around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that 
must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a 
Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s 
Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but 
he’s blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by 
Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play 
by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back 
in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and 
off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding 
Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, 
Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — 
GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” 

Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and 
moans from the Slytherins. 

“Budge up there, move along.” 

“Hagrid!” 

Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid 
enough space to join them. 

“Bin watchin’ from me hut,” said Hagrid, patting a 
large pair of binoculars around his neck, “But it isn’t 
the same as bein’ in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch 
yet, eh?” 

“Nope,” said Ron. “Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.” 

“Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said 
Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at 
the speck that was Harry. 



Page | 209 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, 
squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was 
part of his and Wood’s game plan. 

“Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the 
Snitch,” Wood had said. “We don’t want you attacked 
before you have to be.” 

When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple 
of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was 
back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught 
sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection 
from one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a 
Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a 
cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and 
Fred Weasley came chasing after it. 

“All right there, Harry?” he had time to yell, as he 
beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint. 

“Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying, 
“Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, 
and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a 
moment — was that the Snitch?” 

A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey 
dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his 
shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left 
ear. 

Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived 
downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker 
Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they 
hurtled toward the Snitch — all the Chasers seemed 
to have forgotten what they were supposed to be 
doing as they hung in midair to watch. 



Page | 210 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry was faster than Higgs — he could see the little 
round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead — he 
put on an extra spurt of speed — 

WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors 
below — Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, 
and Harry’s broom spun off course, Harry holding on 
for dear life. 

“Foul!” screamed the Gryffindors. 

Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered 
a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all 
the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had 
disappeared from sight again. 

Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send 
him off, ref! Red card!” 

“What are you talking about, Dean?” said Ron. 

“Red card!” said Dean furiously. “In soccer you get 
shown the red card and you’re out of the game!” 

“But this isn’t soccer, Dean,” Ron reminded him. 

Hagrid, however, was on Dean’s side. 

“They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked 
Harry outta the air.” 

Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. 

“So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of 
cheating — ” 

“Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall. 

“I mean, after that open and revolting foul — ” 

Page | 211 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Jordan, I’m warning you — ” 



“All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor 
Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a 
penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it 
away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor 
still in possession.” 

It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went 
spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. 
His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a 
split second, he thought he was going to fall. He 
gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and 
knees. He’d never felt anything like that. 

It happened again. It was as though the broom was 
trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands 
did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry 
tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts — 
he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out — 
and then he realized that his broom was completely 
out of his control. He couldn’t turn it. He couldn’t 
direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and 
every now and then making violent swishing 
movements that almost unseated him. 

Lee was still commentating. 

“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — 
passes Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face 
by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, 
Professor — Slytherins score — oh no ...” 

The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have 
noticed that Harry’s broom was behaving strangely It 
was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, 
jerking and twitching as it went.

“Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing,” Hagrid 
mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. “If I 
didn’ know better, I’d say he’d lost control of his 
broom ... but he can’t have. ...” 

Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over 
the stands. His broom had started to roll over and 
over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then 
the whole crowd gasped. Harry’s broom had given a 
wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling 
from it, holding on with only one hand. 

“Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?” 
Seamus whispered. 

“Can’t have,” Hagrid said, his voice shaking. “Can’t 
nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful 
Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two 
Thousand.” 

At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid ’s binoculars, 
but instead of looking up at Harry, she started 
looking frantically at the crowd. 

“What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray-faced. 

“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.” 

Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle 
of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on 
Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath. 

“He’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said 
Hermione. 

“What should we do?” 

“Leave it to me.” 



Page | 213 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had 
disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on 
Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost 
impossible for him to hang on much longer. The 
whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the 
Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one 
of their brooms, but it was no good — every time they 
got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They 
dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously 
hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the 
Quaffle and scored five times without anyone 
noticing. 

“Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately. 

Hermione had fought her way across to the stand 
where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row 
behind him; she didn’t even stop to say sorry as she 
knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in 
front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled 
out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen 
words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto 
the hem of Snape ’s robes. 

It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize 
that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had 
done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar 
in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row — 
Snape would never know what had happened. 

It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able 
to clamber back on to his broom. 

“Neville, you can look!” Ron said. Neville had been 
sobbing into Hagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes. 

Harry was speeding toward the ground when the 
crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though 



Page | 214 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




he was about to be sick — he hit the field on all fours 
— coughed — and something gold fell into his hand. 

“I’ve got the Snitch!” he shouted, waving it above his 
head, and the game ended in complete confusion. 

“He didn’t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,” Flint was 
still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no 
difference — Harry hadn’t broken any rules and Lee 
Jordan was still happily shouting the results — 
Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy 
points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He 
was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s 
hut, with Ron and Hermione. 

“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I 
saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, 
he wouldn’t take his eyes off you.” 

“Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of 
what had gone on next to him in the stands. “Why 
would Snape do somethin’ like that?” 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, 
wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the 
truth. 

“I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid. 
“He tried to get past that three-headed dog on 
Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal 
whatever it’s guarding.” 

Hagrid dropped the teapot. 

“How do you know about Fluffy?” he said. 

“ Fluffy ?” 



Page | 215 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie 
I met in the pub las’ year — I lent him to Dumbledore 
to guard the — ” 

“Yes?” said Harry eagerly. 

“Now, don’t ask me anymore,” said Hagrid gruffly. 
“That’s top secret, that is.” 

“But Snape’s trying to steal it.” 

“Rubbish,” said Hagrid again. “Snape’s a Hogwarts 
teacher, he’d do nothin’ of the sort.” 

“So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried 
Hermione. 

The afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have 
changed her mind about Snape. 

“I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all 
about them! You’ve got to keep eye contact, and 
Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw him!” 

“I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly. “I don’ 
know why Harry’s broom acted like that, but Snape 
wouldn’ try an’ kill a student! Now, listen to me, all 
three of yeh — yer meddlin’ in things that don’ 
concern yeh. It’s dangerous. You forget that dog, an’ 
you forget what it’s guardin’, that’s between Professor 
Dumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel — ■” 

“Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas 
Flamel involved, is there?” 

Hagrid looked furious with himself.

THE MIRROR OF ERISED 

Christmas was coming. One morning in mid- 
December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in 
several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the 
Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several 
snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, 
bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that 
managed to battle their way through the stormy sky 
to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by 
Hagrid before they could fly off again. 

No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the 
Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had 
roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and 
a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. 
Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in 
the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist 
before them and they kept as close as possible to 
their hot cauldrons. 

“I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions 
class, “for all those people who have to stay at 



Page | 217 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted 
at home.” 

He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and 
Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out 
powdered spine of lion-fish, ignored them. Malfoy had 
been even more unpleasant than usual since the 
Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had 
lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a 
wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as 
Seeker next. Then he’d realized that nobody found 
this funny, because they were all so impressed at the 
way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking 
broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone 
back to taunting Harry about having no proper 
family. 

It was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet 
Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come 
around the week before, making a list of students 
who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had 
signed up at once. He didn’t feel sorry for himself at 
all; this would probably be the best Christmas he’d 
ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, 
because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania 
to visit Charlie. 

When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, 
they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. 
Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a 
loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind 
it. 

“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking his 
head through the branches. 

“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.” 



Page | 218 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Would you mind moving out of the way?” came 
Malfoy’s cold drawl from behind them. “Are you trying 
to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be 
gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I 
suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a 
palace compared to what your family’s used to.” 

Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs. 

“WEASLEY!” 

Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes. 

“He was provoked, Professor Snape,” said Hagrid, 
sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. 
“Malfoy was insultin’ his family.” 

“Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, 
Hagrid,” said Snape silkily. “Five points from 
Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t more. 
Move along, all of you.” 

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the 
tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. 

“I’ll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s 
back, “one of these days, I’ll get him — ” 

“I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” 

“Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said 
Hagrid. “Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the 
Great Hall, looks a treat.” 

So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off 
to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and 
Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas 
decorations. 



Page | 219 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, 
would you?” 

The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and 
mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than 
twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the 
room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering 
with hundreds of candles. 

“How many days you got left until yer holidays?” 
Hagrid asked. 

“Just one,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me — 
Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we 
should be in the library.” 

“Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing his eyes 
away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden 
bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing 
them over the branches of the new tree. 

“The library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the 
hall. “Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?” 

“Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told him brightly. 

“Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been 
trying to find out who he is.” 

“You what?” Hagrid looked shocked. “Listen here — 
I’ve told yeh — drop it. It’s nothin’ to you what that 
dog’s guardin’.” 

“We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s 
all,” said Hermione. 

“Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?” 
Harry added. “We must’ve been through hundreds of 
books already and we can’t find him anywhere — just 



Page | 220 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




give us a hint — I know I’ve read his name 
somewhere.” 

“I’m sayin’ nothin’,” said Hagrid flatly. 

“Just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said Ron, 
and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried 
off to the library. 

They had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s 
name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how 
else were they going to find out what Snape was 
trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to 
know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might 
have done to get himself into a book. He wasn’t in 
Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable 
Magical Names of Our Time ; he was missing, too, from 
Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of 
Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of 
course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of 
thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds 
of narrow rows. 

Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had 
decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of 
books and started pulling them off the shelves at 
random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted 
Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel 
wasn’t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you 
needed a specially signed note from one of the 
teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he 
knew he’d never get one. These were the books 
containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at 
Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying 
advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. 

“What are you looking for, boy?” 

“Nothing,” said Harry. 

Page | 221 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather 
duster at him. 

“You’d better get out, then. Go on — out!” 

Wishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some 
story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione 
had already agreed they’d better not ask Madam 
Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure 
she’d be able to tell them, but they couldn’t risk 
Snape hearing what they were up to. 

Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other 
two had found anything, but he wasn’t very hopeful. 
They had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as 
they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t 
surprising they’d found nothing. What they really 
needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince 
breathing down their necks. 

Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, 
shaking their heads. They went off to lunch. 

“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” 
said Hermione. “And send me an owl if you find 
anything.” 

“And you could ask your parents if they know who 
Flamel is,” said Ron. “It’d be safe to ask them.” 

“Very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said Hermione. 

Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were 
having too good a time to think much about Flamel. 
They had the dormitory to themselves and the 
common room was far emptier than usual, so they 
were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They 
sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a 
toasting fork — bread, English muffins, 

Page | 222 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




marshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy 
expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they 
wouldn’t work. 

Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This 
was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures 
were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in 
battle. Ron’s set was very old and battered. Like 
everything else he owned, it had once belonged to 
someone else in his family — in this case, his 
grandfather. However, old chessmen weren’t a 
drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had 
trouble getting them to do what he wanted. 

Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had 
lent him, and they didn’t trust him at all. He wasn’t a 
very good player yet and they kept shouting different 
bits of advice at him, which was confusing. “Don’t 
send me there, can’t you see his knight? Send him, we 
can afford to lose him.” 

On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward 
to the next day for the food and the fun, but not 
expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in 
the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a 
small pile of packages at the foot of his bed. 

“Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry 
scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe. 

“You, too,” said Harry. “Will you look at this? I’ve got 
some presents!” 

“What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to 
his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s. 

Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in 
thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To 
Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden 

Page | 223 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry 
blew it — it sounded a bit like an owl. 

A second, very small parcel contained a note. 

We received your message and enclose your Christmas 
present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped 
to the note was a fifty-pence piece. 

“That’s friendly,” said Harry. 

Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence. 

“ Weird\ ” he said, “What a shape! This is money?” 

“You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how 
pleased Ron was. “Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — 
so who sent these?” 

“I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, 
turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy 
parcel. “My mom. I told her you didn’t expect any 
presents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s made you 
a Weasley sweater.” 

Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand- 
knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of 
homemade fudge. 

“Every year she makes us a sweater,” said Ron, 
unwrapping his own, “and mine’s always maroon.” 

“That’s really nice of her,” said Harry, trying the 
fudge, which was very tasty. 

His next present also contained candy — a large box 
of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. 



Page | 224 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt 
it. It was very light. He unwrapped it. 

Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the 
floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped. 

“I’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice, 
dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten 
from Hermione. “If that’s what I think it is — they’re 
really rare, and really valuable.” 

“What is it?” 

Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It 
was strange to the touch, like water woven into 
material. 

“It’s an Invisibility Cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on 
his face. “I’m sure it is — try it on.” 

Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron 
gave a yell. 

“It is! Look down!” 

Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He 
dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection 
looked back at him, just his head suspended in 
midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the 
cloak over his head and his reflection vanished 
completely. 

“There’s a note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out of 
it!” 



Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. 
Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen 
before were the following words: 



Page | 225 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Your father left this in my possession before he died. It 
is time it was returned to you. 

Use it well. 

A Very Merry Christmas to you. 

There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron 
was admiring the cloak. 

“I’d give anuthinq for one of these,” he said. “Anuthinq. 
What’s the matter?” 

“Nothing,” said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had 
sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his 
father? 

Before he could say or think anything else, the 
dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George 
Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly 
out of sight. He didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone 
else yet. 

“Merry Christmas!” 

“Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!” 

Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one 
with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. 

“Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred, 
holding up Harry’s sweater. “She obviously makes 
more of an effort if you’re not family.” 

“Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George 
demanded. “Come on, get it on, they’re lovely and 
warm.” 



Page | 226 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as he 
pulled it over his head. 

“You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George observed. 

“I suppose she thinks you don’t forget your name. But 
we’re not stupid — we know we’re called Gred and 
Forge.” 

“What’s all this noise?” 

Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, 
looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway 
through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a 
lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized. 

“P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we’re all 
wearing ours, even Harry got one.” 

“I — don’t — want — ” said Percy thickly, as the twins 
forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses 
askew. 

“And you’re not sitting with the prefects today, 
either,” said George. “Christmas is a time for family.” 

They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms 
pinned to his side by his sweater. 

Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas 
dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of 
roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; 
tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich 
gravy and cranberry sauce — and stacks of wizard 
crackers every few feet along the table. These 
fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble 
Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their 
little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. 
Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t 
just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and 
Page | 227 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from 
the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several 
live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore 
had swapped his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered 
bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor 
Flitwick had just read him. 

Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. 
Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle 
embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting 
redder and redder in the face as he called for more 
wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the 
cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and 
blushed, her top hat lopsided. 

When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down 
with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a 
pack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow- 
Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess 
set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a 
nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. 
Norris’s Christmas dinner. 

Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon 
having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, 
cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the 
fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry 
broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to 
Ron. He suspected he wouldn’t have lost so badly if 
Percy hadn’t tried to help him so much. 

After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, 
and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy 
to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy 
chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower 
because they’d stolen his prefect badge. 

It had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet 
something had been nagging at the back of his mind 

Page | 228 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to 
think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had 
sent it. 

Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing 
mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon 
as he’d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry 
leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the 
cloak out from under it. 

His father’s ... this had been his father’s. He let the 
material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light 
as air. Use it well, the note had said. 

He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and 
wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at 
his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a 
very funny feeling. 

Use it well. 

Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of 
Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement 
flooded through him as he stood there in the dark 
and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, 
and Filch would never know. 

Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? 
Something held him back — his father’s cloak — he 
felt that this time — the first time — he wanted to use 
it alone. 

He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across 
the common room, and climbed through the portrait 
hole. 

“Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said 
nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor. 



Page | 229 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, 
and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted 
Section in the library. He’d be able to read as long as 
he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel 
was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight 
around him as he walked. 

The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a 
lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The 
lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and 
even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, 
the sight gave him the creeps. 

The Restricted Section was right at the back of the 
library. Stepping carefully over the rope that 
separated these books from the rest of the library, he 
held up his lamp to read the titles. 

They didn’t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold 
letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn’t 
understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a 
dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The 
hairs on the back of Harry’s neck prickled. Maybe he 
was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint 
whispering was coming from the books, as though 
they knew someone was there who shouldn’t be. 

He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down 
carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom 
shelf for an interesting-looking book. A large black 
and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out 
with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, 
balancing it on his knee, let it fall open. 

A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — 
the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but 
the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, 
earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked 
over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he 
Page | 230 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside — 
stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran 
for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, 
wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry 
slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked 
off up the corridor, the book’s shrieks still ringing in 
his ears. 

He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of 
armor. He had been so busy getting away from the 
library, he hadn’t paid attention to where he was 
going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn’t 
recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of 
armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be 
five floors above there. 

“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if 
anyone was wandering around at night, and 
somebody’s been in the library — Restricted Section.” 

Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he 
was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, 
greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it 
was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section? Well, 
they can’t be far, we’ll catch them.” 

Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape 
came around the corner ahead. They couldn’t see 
him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if 
they came much nearer they’d knock right into him — 
the cloak didn’t stop him from being solid. 

He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood 
ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed 
through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, 
and to his relief he managed to get inside the room 
without their noticing anything. They walked straight 
past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing 
deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That 
Page | 231 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




had been close, very close. It was a few seconds 
before he noticed anything about the room he had 
hidden in. 



It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes 
of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and 
there was an upturned wastepaper basket — but 
propped against the wall facing him was something 
that didn’t look as if it belonged there, something that 
looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it 
out of the way. 

It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, 
with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed 
feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: 
Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. 

His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch 
and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, 
wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. 
He stepped in front of it. 

He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself 
from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was 
pounding far more furiously than when the book had 
screamed — for he had seen not only himself in the 
mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right 
behind him. 

But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he 
turned slowly back to the mirror. 

There he was, reflected in it, white and scared- 
looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least 
ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder — but still, 
no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was 
he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this 
mirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or 
not?

He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing 
right behind his reflection was smiling at him and 
waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind 
him. If she was really there, he’d touch her, their 
reflections were so close together, but he felt only air 
— she and the others existed only in the mirror. 

She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair 
and her eyes — her eyes are just like mine, Harry 
thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright 
green — exactly the same shape, but then he noticed 
that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same 
time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next 
to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and 
his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just 
as Harry’s did. 

Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose 
was nearly touching that of his reflection. 

“Mom?” he whispered. “Dad?” 

They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry 
looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, 
and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses 
like his, even a little old man who looked as though 
he had Harry’s knobbly knees — Harry was looking at 
his family, for the first time in his life. 

The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared 
hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against 
the glass as though he was hoping to fall right 
through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of 
ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. 

How long he stood there, he didn’t know. The 
reflections did not fade and he looked and looked 
until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. 
He couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way back to 

Page | 233 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother’s face, 
whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the 
room. 

“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly. 

“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show 
you the mirror.” 

“I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly. 

“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, 
you’ll be able to show me your other brothers and 
everyone.” 

“You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just 
come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe 
it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding 
Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why 
aren’t you eating anything?” 

Harry couldn’t eat. He had seen his parents and 
would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost 
forgotten about Flamel. It didn’t seem very important 
anymore. Who cared what the three-headed dog was 
guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? 

“Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.” 

What Harry feared most was that he might not be 
able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered 
in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly 
the next night. They tried retracing Harry’s route from 
the library, wandering around the dark passageways 
for nearly an hour. 

“I’m freezing,” said Ron. “Let’s forget it and go back.” 

“IVo!” Harry hissed. “I know it’s here somewhere.” 

Page | 234 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the 
opposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron 
started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, 
Harry spotted the suit of armor. 

“It’s here — just here — yes!” 

They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak 
from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror. 

There they were. His mother and father beamed at the 
sight of him. 

“See?” Harry whispered. 

“I can’t see anything.” 

“Look! Look at them all ... there are loads of them. ...” 
“I can only see you.” 

“Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.” 

Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the 
mirror, he couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ron 
in his paisley pajamas. 

Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image. 
“Look at me!” he said. 

“Can you see all your family standing around you?” 

“No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — 
and I’m Head Boy!” 

“What?” 



Page | 235 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and 
I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — 
I’m Quidditch captain, too!” 

Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to 
look excitedly at Harry. 

“Do you think this mirror shows the future?” 

“How can it? All my family are dead — let me have 
another look — ” 

“You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit 
more time.” 

“You’re only holding the Quidditch Cup, what’s 
interesting about that? I want to see my parents.” 

“Don’t push me — ” 

A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to 
their discussion. They hadn’t realized how loudly they 
had been talking. 

“Quick!” 

Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous 
eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and 
Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing 
— did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an 
age, she turned and left. 

“This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet 
she heard us. Come on.” 

And Ron pulled Harry out of the room. 

The snow still hadn’t melted the next morning. 



Page | 236 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron. 



“No.” 

“Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid?” 

“No ... you go ...” 

“I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that 
mirror. Don’t go back tonight.” 

“Why not?” 

“I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and 
anyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already. 
Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. 
So what if they can’t see you? What if they walk into 
you? What if you knock something over?” 

“You sound like Hermione.” 

“I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.” 

But Harry only had one thought in his head, which 
was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn’t 
going to stop him. 

That third night he found his way more quickly than 
before. He was walking so fast he knew he was 
making more noise than was wise, but he didn’t meet 
anyone. 

And there were his mother and father smiling at him 
again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. 
Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the 
mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying 
here all night with his family. Nothing at all. 

Except — 

Page | 237 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“So — back again, Harry?” 

Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He 
looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the 
wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry 
must have walked straight past him, so desperate to 
get to the mirror he hadn’t noticed him. 

“I — I didn’t see you, sir.” 

“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make 
you,” said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see 
that he was smiling. 

“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on 
the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, 
have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” 

“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” 

“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” 

“It — well — it shows me my family — ” 

“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” 

“How did you know — ?” 

“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said 
Dumbledore gently. “Now, can you think what the 
Mirror of Erised shows us all?” 

Harry shook his head. 

“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be 
able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, 
that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly 
as he is. Does that help?” 



Page | 238 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us 
what we want ... whatever we want ...” 

“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us 
nothing more or less than the deepest, most 
desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never 
known your family, see them standing around you. 
Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed 
by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best 
of all of them. However, this mirror will give us 
neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away 
before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been 
driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or 
even possible. 

“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, 
Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If 
you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It 
does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, 
remember that. Now, why don’t you put that 
admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?” 

Harry stood up. 

“Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you 
something?” 

“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled. 
“You may ask me one more thing, however.” 

“What do you see when you look in the mirror?” 

“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” 

Harry stared. 

“One can never have enough socks,” said 
Dumbledore. “Another Christmas has come and gone 



Page | 239 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




and I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on 
giving me books.” 

It was only when he was back in bed that it struck 
Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite 
truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved 
Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal 
question. 



Page | 240 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 






NICHOLAS FLAMBL 

Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking 
for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the 
Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed 
folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he 
could forget what he’d seen in the mirror as easily, 
but he couldn’t. He started having nightmares. Over 
and over again he dreamed about his parents 
disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high 
voice cackled with laughter. 

“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could 
drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told him about 
these dreams. 

Hermione, who came back the day before term 
started, took a different view of things. She was torn 
between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, 
roaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had 
caught you!”), and disappointment that he hadn’t at 
least found out who Nicolas Flamel was. 



Page | 241 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel 
in a library book, even though Harry was still sure 
he’d read the name somewhere. Once term had 
started, they were back to skimming through books 
for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even 
less time than the other two, because Quidditch 
practice had started again. 

Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even 
the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn’t 
dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that 
Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on 
Wood’s side. If they won their next match, against 
Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the 
House Championship for the first time in seven years. 
Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he 
had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after 
training. 

Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice 
session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He’d 
just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept 
dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off 
their brooms. 

“Will you stop messing around!” he yelled. “That’s 
exactly the sort of thing that’ll lose us the match! 
Snape’s refereeing this time, and he’ll be looking for 
any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!” 

George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these 
words. 

“ Snape’s refereeing?” he spluttered through a 
mouthful of mud. “When’s he ever refereed a 
Quidditch match? He’s not going to be fair if we might 
overtake Slytherin.” 



Page | 242 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




The rest of the team landed next to George to 
complain, too. 

“It’s not my fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make 
sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an 
excuse to pick on us.” 

Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had 
another reason for not wanting Snape near him while 
he was playing Quidditch. ... 

The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another 
as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed 
straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where 
he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was 
the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry 
and Ron thought was very good for her. 

“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry 
sat down next to him, “I need to concern” He caught 
sight of Harry’s face. “What’s the matter with you? 

You look terrible.” 

Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, 

Harry told the other two about Snape ’s sudden, 
sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee. 

“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once. 

“Say you’re ill,” said Ron. 

“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested. 

“ Really break your leg,” said Ron. 

“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I 
back out, Gryffindor can’t play at all.” 



Page | 243 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




At that moment Neville toppled into the common 
room. How he had managed to climb through the 
portrait hole was anyone’s guess, because his legs 
had been stuck together with what they recognized at 
once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to 
bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower. 

Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who 
leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville’s 
legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. 

“What happened?” Hermione asked him, leading him 
over to sit with Harry and Ron. 

“Malfoy,” said Neville shakily. “I met him outside the 
library. He said he’d been looking for someone to 
practice that on.” 

“Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged 
Neville. “Report him!” 

Neville shook his head. 

“I don’t want more trouble,” he mumbled. 

“You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville!” said Ron. 
“He’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no 
reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.” 

“There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be 
in Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,” Neville 
choked out. 

Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a 
Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box 
Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to 
Neville, who looked as though he might cry. 



Page | 244 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said. “The 
Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And 
where’s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.” 

Neville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as he 
unwrapped the frog. 

“Thanks, Harry ... I think I’ll go to bed. ... D’you want 
the card, you collect them, don’t you?” 

As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous 
Wizard card. 

“Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was the first one I 
ever — ” 

He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he 
looked up at Ron and Hermione. 

“I’ve found him\” he whispered. “I’ve found Flamel! I 
told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read it 
on the train coming here — listen to this: 

‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of 
the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the 
discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his 
work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’V’ 

Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn’t looked so 
excited since they’d gotten back the marks for their 
very first piece of homework. 

“Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs 
to the girls’ dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had 
time to exchange mystified looks before she was 
dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms. 

“I never thought to look in here!” she whispered 
excitedly. “I got this out of the library weeks ago for a 
bit of light reading.” 

Page | 245 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet 
until she’d looked something up, and started flicking 
frantically through the pages, muttering to herself. 

At last she found what she was looking for. 

“I knew it! I knew it!” 

“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. 
Hermione ignored him. 

“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the 
only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone\” 

This didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected. 

“The what?” said Harry and Ron. 

“Oh, honestly , don’t you two read? Look — read that, 
there.” 

She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and 
Ron read: 

The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with 
making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance 
with astonishing powers. The Stone will transform 
any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of 
Life, which will make the drinker immortal. 

There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone 
over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in 
existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted 
alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated 
his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, 
enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle 
(six hundred and fifty-eight). 



Page | 246 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had 
finished. “The dog must be guarding Flamel’s 
Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep 
it safe for him, because they’re friends and he knew 
someone was after it, that’s why he wanted the Stone 
moved out of Gringotts!” 

“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever 
dying!” said Harry. “No wonder Snape’s after it! 

Anyone would want it.” 

“And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study 
of Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “He’s 
not exactly recent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is 
he?” 

The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, 
while copying down different ways of treating werewolf 
bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they’d 
do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one. It wasn’t 
until Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that 
Harry remembered about Snape and the coming 
match. 

“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I 
don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared 
to face Snape. I’ll show them ... it’ll really wipe the 
smiles off their faces if we win.” 

“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” 
said Hermione. 

As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became 
more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and 
Hermione. The rest of the team wasn’t too calm, 
either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House 
Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for 
seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such 
a biased referee? 

Page | 247 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, 
but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever 
he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape 
was following him, trying to catch him on his own. 
Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly 
torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape 
possibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s 
Stone? Harry didn’t see how he could — yet he 
sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could 
read minds. 

Harry knew, when they wished him good luck 
outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron 
and Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever 
see him alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call 
comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep 
talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked 
up his Nimbus Two Thousand. 

Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in 
the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand 
why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had 
both brought their wands to the match. Little did 
Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly 
practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten the 
idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready 
to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to 
hurt Harry. 

“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione 
muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve. 

“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.” 

Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry 
aside. 

“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever 
need an early capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish 

Page | 248 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too 
much.” 

“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, 
peering out of the door. “Even — blimey — 
Dumbledore’s come to watch!” 

Harry’s heart did a somersault. 

“Dumbledore?” he said, dashing to the door to make 
sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that 
silver beard. 

Harry could have laughed out loud with relief. He was 
safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare 
to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching. 

Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as 
the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron 
noticed, too. 

“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” he told 
Hermione. “Look — they’re off. Ouch!” 

Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It 
was Malfoy. 

“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.” 

Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle. 

“Wonder how long Potter’s going to stay on his broom 
this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, 
Weasley?” 

Ron didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded 
Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit 
a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers 
crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, 

Page | 249 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the 
Snitch. 

“You know how I think they choose people for the 
Gryffindor team?” said Malfoy loudly a few minutes 
later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty 
for no reason at all. “It’s people they feel sorry for. 

See, there’s Potter, who’s got no parents, then there’s 
the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be 
on the team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” 

Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face 
Malfoy. 

“I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,” he stammered. 

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but 
Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, 
said, “You tell him, Neville.” 

“Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than 
Weasley, and that’s saying something.” 

Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking 
point with anxiety about Harry. 

“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word — ” 

“Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry — !” 

“What? Where?” 

Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, 
which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. 
Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, 
as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet. 

“You’re in luck, Weasley, Potter’s obviously spotted 
some money on the ground!” said Malfoy. 

Page | 250 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was 
happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to 
the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the 
back of his seat to help. 

“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto 
her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — 
she didn’t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around 
under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from 
the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle. 

Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in 
time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing 
him by inches — the next second, Harry had pulled 
out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch 
clasped in his hand. 

The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one 
could ever remember the Snitch being caught so 
quickly. 

“Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game’s over! Harry’s 
won! We’ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!” shrieked 
Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and 
hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front. 

Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. 
He couldn’t believe it. He’d done it — the game was 
over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors 
came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land 
nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt 
a hand on his shoulder and looked up into 
Dumbledore’s smiling face. 

“Well done,” said Dumbledore quietly, so that only 
Harry could hear. “Nice to see you haven’t been 
brooding about that mirror . . . been keeping busy . . . 
excellent ...” 



Page | 251 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Snape spat bitterly on the ground. 



Jc Jc Jc 



Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to 
take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the 
broomshed. He couldn’t ever remember feeling 
happier. He’d really done something to be proud of 
now — no one could say he was just a famous name 
any more. The evening air had never smelled so 
sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the 
last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: 
Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; 
Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and 
down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed. 

Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the 
wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its 
windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in 
the lead. He’d done it, he’d shown Snape. ... 

And speaking of Snape . . . 

A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of 
the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked 
as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. 
Harry’s victory faded from his mind as he watched. 
He recognized the figure’s prowling walk. Snape, 
sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at 
dinner — what was going on? 

Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand 
and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw 
Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed. 

The trees were so thick he couldn’t see where Snape 
had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, 
brushing the top branches of trees until he heard 



Page | 252 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly 
in a towering beech tree. 

He climbed carefully along one of the branches, 
holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through 
the leaves. 

Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he 
wasn’t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn’t 
make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering 
worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they 
were saying. 

"... d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of 
all p-places, Severus ...” 

“Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,” said Snape, his 
voice icy. “Students aren’t supposed to know about 
the Sorcerer’s Stone, after all.” 

Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling 
something. Snape interrupted him. 

“Have you found out how to get past that beast of 
Hagrid’s yet?” 

“B-b-but Severus, I — ” 

“You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” said 
Snape, taking a step toward him. 

“I-I don’t know what you — ” 

“You know perfectly well what I mean.” 

An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the 
tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, 

“ — your little bit of hocus-pocus. I’m waiting.” 



Page | 253 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“B-but I d-d-don’t — ” 



“Very well,” Snape cut in. “Well have another little 
chat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over 
and decided where your loyalties lie.” 

He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the 
clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see 
Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was 
petrified.

“Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked. 

“We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping 
Harry on the back. “And I gave Malfoy a black eye, 
and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single- 
handed! He’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says 
he’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin! 
Everyone’s waiting for you in the common room, we’re 
having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and 
stuff from the kitchens.” 

“Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let’s 
find an empty room, you wait ’til you hear this. ...” 

He made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting 
the door behind them, then he told them what he’d 
seen and heard. 

“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and 
Snape’s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He 
asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he said 
something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon 
there are other things guarding the stone apart from 
Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell 



Page | 254 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that 
Snape needs to break through — ” 

“So you mean the Stone’s only safe as long as Quirrell 
stands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm. 

“It’ll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Ron. 



Page | 255 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 






NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN 
RIDGEBACK 

Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they’d 
thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be 
getting paler and thinner, but it didn’t look as though 
he’d cracked yet. 

Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door 
to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape 
was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which 
surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever 
Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an 
encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling 
people off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter. 

Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the 
Sorcerer’s Stone. She had started drawing up study 
schedules and color-coding all her notes. Harry and 
Ron wouldn’t have minded, but she kept nagging 
them to do the same. 



Page | 256 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



“Hermione, the exams are ages away.” 

“Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped. “That’s not ages, 
that’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.” 

“But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded 
her. “Anyway, what are you studying for, you already 
know it all.” 

“What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize 
we need to pass these exams to get into the second 
year? They’re very important, I should have started 
studying a month ago, I don’t know what’s gotten into 
me.” 

Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking 
along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so 
much homework on them that the Easter holidays 
weren’t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It 
was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting 
the twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing wand 
movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron 
spent most of their free time in the library with her, 
trying to get through all their extra work. 

“I’ll never remember this,” Ron burst out one 
afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking 
longingly out of the library window. It was the first 
really fine day they’d had in months. The sky was a 
clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in 
the air of summer coming. 

Harry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand 
Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until he 
heard Ron say, “Hagrid! What are you doing in the 
library?” 



Page | 257 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind 
his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin 
overcoat. 

“Jus’ lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voice that got their 
interest at once. “An’ what’re you lot up ter?” He 
looked suddenly suspicious. “Yer not still lookin’ fer 
Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?” 

“Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said Ron 
impressively. “And we know what that dog’s guarding, 
it’s a Sorcerer’s St — ” 

“Shhhh\” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if 
anyone was listening. “Don’ go shoutin’ about it, 
what’s the matter with yeh?” 

“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a 
matter of fact,” said Harry, “about what’s guarding 
the Stone apart from Fluffy — ” 

“SHHHH!” said Hagrid again. “Listen — come an’ see 
me later, I’m not promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, 
but don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here, students aren’ 
s’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve told yeh — ” 

“See you later, then,” said Harry. 

Hagrid shuffled off. 

“What was he hiding behind his back?” said 
Hermione thoughtfully. 

“Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?” 

“I’m going to see what section he was in,” said Ron, 
who’d had enough of working. He came back a 
minute later with a pile of books in his arms and 
slammed them down on the table. 

Page | 258 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Dragons'.” he whispered. “Hagrid was looking up stuff 
about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great 
Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon 
Keeper’s Guide.” 

“Hagrid ’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the 
first time I ever met him,” said Harry. 

“But it’s against our laws,” said Ron. “Dragon 
breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks’ Convention 
of 1709, everyone knows that. It’s hard to stop 
Muggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in 
the back garden — anyway, you can’t tame dragons, 
it’s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie’s got 
off wild ones in Romania.” 

“But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?” said Harry. 

“Of course there are,” said Ron. “Common Welsh 
Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic 
has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind 
have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted 
them, to make them forget.” 

“So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione. 

When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s 
hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all 
the curtains were closed. Hagrid called “Who is it?” 
before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly 
behind them. 

It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a 
warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. 

Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat 
sandwiches, which they refused. 

“So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?” 



Page | 259 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes,” said Harry. There was no point beating around 
the bush. “We were wondering if you could tell us 
what’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from 
Fluffy.” 

Hagrid frowned at him. 

“O’ course I can’t,” he said. “Number one, I don’ know 
meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I 
wouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s here fer a good 
reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I 
s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all? Beats me how 
yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.” 

“Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, 
but you do know, you know everything that goes on 
round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering 
voice. Hagrid ’s beard twitched and they could tell he 
was smiling. “We only wondered who had done the 
guarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We wondered 
who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, 
apart from you.” 

Hagrid ’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and 
Ron beamed at Hermione. 

“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that ... 
let’s see ... he borrowed Fluffy from me ... then some 
o’ the teachers did enchantments ... Professor Sprout 
— Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ” he 
ticked them off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell — 
an’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course. 

Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor 
Snape.” 

“Snape?” 



Page | 260 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, 
Snape helped protect the Stone, he’s not about ter 
steal it.” 

Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the 
same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting 
the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the 
other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew 
everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and 
how to get past Fluffy. 

“You’re the only one who knows how to get past 
Fluffy, aren’t you, Hagrid?” said Harry anxiously. 

“And you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you? Not even 
one of the teachers?” 

“Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” said 
Hagrid proudly. 

“Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the 
others. “Hagrid, can we have a window open? I’m 
boiling.” 

“Can’t, Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid. Harry noticed him 
glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too. 

“Hagrid — what’s that?” 

But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of 
the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg. 

“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, 
“That’s — er ...” 

“Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching 
over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. “It must’ve 
cost you a fortune.” 



Page | 261 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Won it,” said Hagrid. “Las’ night. I was down in the 
village havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards 
with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of 
it, ter be honest.” 

“But what are you going to do with it when it’s 
hatched?” said Hermione. 

“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Hagrid, pulling 
a large book from under his pillow. “Got this outta the 
library — Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit — 
it’s a bit outta date, o’ course, but it’s all in here. Keep 
the egg in the fire, ’cause their mothers breathe on 
’em, see, an’ when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o’ 
brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An’ 
see here — how ter recognize diff’rent eggs — what I 
got there’s a Norwegian Ridge-back. They’re rare, 
them.” 

He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione 
didn’t. 

“Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” she said. 

But Hagrid wasn’t listening. He was humming merrily 
as he stoked the fire. 

So now they had something else to worry about: what 
might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was 
hiding an illegal dragon in his hut. 

“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron 
sighed, as evening after evening they struggled 
through all the extra homework they were getting. 
Hermione had now started making study schedules 
for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts. 



Page | 262 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry 
another note from Hagrid. He had written only two 
words: It’s hatching. 

Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to 
the hut. Hermione wouldn’t hear of it. 

“Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going 
to see a dragon hatching?” 

“We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s 
nothing to what Hagrid ’s going to be in when someone 
finds out what he’s doing — ” 

“Shut up!” Harry whispered. 

Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped 
dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn’t 
like the look on Malfoy’s face at all. 

Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology 
and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to 
Hagrid’s with the other two during morning break. 
When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of 
their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels 
at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge 
of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed 
and excited. 

“It’s nearly out.” He ushered them inside. 

The egg was lying on the table. There were deep 
cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny 
clicking noise was coming from it. 

They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched 
with bated breath. 



Page | 263 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg 
split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It 
wasn’t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a 
crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge 
compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout 
with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, 
orange eyes. 

It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout. 

“Isn’t he beautiful?” Hagrid murmured. He reached 
out a hand to stroke the dragon’s head. It snapped at 
his fingers, showing pointed fangs. 

“Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!” said Hagrid. 

“Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian 
Ridgebacks grow, exactly?” 

Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly 
drained from his face — he leapt to his feet and ran to 
the window. 

“What’s the matter?” 

“Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains 
— it’s a kid — he’s runnin’ back up ter the school.” 

Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a 
distance there was no mistaking him. 

Malfoy had seen the dragon. 

Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face 
during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
very nervous. They spent most of their free time in 
Hagrid ’s darkened hut, trying to reason with him. 

“Just let him go,” Harry urged. “Set him free.” 

Page | 264 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I can’t,” said Hagrid. “He’s too little. He’d die.” 



They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times 
in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its 
nostrils. Hagrid hadn’t been doing his gamekeeping 
duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. 
There were empty brandy bottles and chicken 
feathers all over the floor. 

“I’ve decided to call him Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking 
at the dragon with misty eyes. “He really knows me 
now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where’s Mommy?” 

“He’s lost his marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear. 

“Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give it two weeks and 
Norbert’s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy 
could go to Dumbledore at any moment.” 

Hagrid bit his lip. 

“I — I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’ 
dump him, can’t.” 

Harry suddenly turned to Ron. 

“Charlie,” he said. 

“You’re losing it, too,” said Ron. “I’m Ron, remember?” 

“No — Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania. 
Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. 
Charlie can take care of him and then put him back 
in the wild!” 

“Brilliant!” said Ron. “How about it, Hagrid?” 

And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send 
an owl to Charlie to ask him. 

Page | 265 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




The following week dragged by. Wednesday night 
found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the 
common room, long after everyone else had gone to 
bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight 
when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out 
of nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s Invisibility Cloak. 
He had been down at Hagrid’s hut, helping him feed 
Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate. 

“It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which 
was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. “I’m not going 
to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that 
dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but 
the way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a 
fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off 
for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a 
lullaby.” 

There was a tap on the dark window. 

“It’s Hedwig!” said Harry, hurrying to let her in. “She’ll 
have Charlie’s answer!” 

The three of them put their heads together to read the 
note. 

Dear Ron, 

How are you? Thanks for the letter — I’d be glad to 
take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won’t be easy 
getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send 
him over with some friends of mine who are coming to 
visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn’t be seen 
carrying an illegal dragon. 

Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at 
midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and 
take him away while it’s still dark. 



Page | 266 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Send me an answer as soon as possible. 



Love, 

Charlie 

They looked at one another. 

“We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It 
shouldn’t be too difficult — I think the cloak’s big 
enough to cover two of us and Norbert.” 

It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that 
the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of 
Norbert — and Malfoy. 

There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron’s bitten 
hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn’t 
know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey — 
would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, 
though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty 
shade of green. It looked as if Norbert’s fangs were 
poisonous. 

Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing 
at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in 
bed. 

“It’s not just my hand,” he whispered, “although that 
feels like it’s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam 
Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he 
could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept 
threatening to tell her what really bit me — I’ve told 
her it was a dog, but I don’t think she believes me — I 
shouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that’s 
why he’s doing this.” 

Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down. 

Page | 267 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said 
Hermione, but this didn’t soothe Ron at all. On the 
contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat. 

“Midnight on Saturday!” he said in a hoarse voice. 

“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s 
letter was in that book Malfoy took, he’s going to 
know we’re getting rid of Norbert.” 

Harry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer. 
Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made 
them leave, saying Ron needed sleep. 

“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told 
Hermione. “We haven’t got time to send Charlie 
another owl, and this could be our only chance to get 
rid of Norbert. We’ll have to risk it. And we have got 
the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about 
that.” 

They found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a 
bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who 
opened a window to talk to them. 

“I won’t let you in,” he puffed. “Norbert’s at a tricky 
stage — nothin’ I can’t handle.” 

When they told him about Charlie’s letter, his eyes 
filled with tears, although that might have been 
because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg. 

“Aargh! It’s all right, he only got my boot — jus’ 
playin’ — he’s only a baby, after all.” 

The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the 
windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to 
the castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly 
enough. 



Page | 268 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time 
came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn’t 
been so worried about what they had to do. It was a 
very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late 
arriving at Hagrid ’s hut because they’d had to wait for 
Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, 
where he’d been playing tennis against the wall. 

Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate. 

“He’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,” 
said Hagrid in a muffled voice. “An’ I’ve packed his 
teddy bear in case he gets lonely.” 

From inside the crate came ripping noises that 
sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his 
head torn off. 

“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and 
Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak 
and stepped underneath it themselves. “Mommy will 
never forget you!” 

How they managed to get the crate back up to the 
castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as 
they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the 
entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up 
another staircase, then another — even one of Harry’s 
shortcuts didn’t make the work much easier. 

“Nearly there!” Harry panted as they reached the 
corridor beneath the tallest tower. 

Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them 
almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were 
already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, 
staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling 
with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared. 



Page | 269 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair 
net, had Malfoy by the ear. 



“Detention!” she shouted. “And twenty points from 
Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the 
night, how dare you — ” 

“You don’t understand, Professor. Harry Potter’s 
coming — he’s got a dragon!” 

“What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! 
Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, 
Malfoy!” 

The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower 
seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not 
until they’d stepped out into the cold night air did 
they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe 
properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig. 

“Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!” 

“Don’t,” Harry advised her. 

Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert 
thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, 
four broomsticks came swooping down out of the 
darkness. 

Charlie’s friends were a cheery lot. They showed 
Harry and Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so 
they could suspend Norbert between them. They all 
helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry 
and Hermione shook hands with the others and 
thanked them very much. 

At last, Norbert was going ... going ... gone. 



Page | 270 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their 
hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was 
off them. No more dragon — Malfoy in detention — 
what could spoil their happiness? 

The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the 
stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face 
loomed suddenly out of the darkness. 

“Well, well, well,” he whispered, “we are in trouble.” 

They’d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower. 



Page | 271 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 








THE FORBIDDEN FOREST 

Things couldn’t have been worse. 

Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall’s 
study on the first floor, where they sat and waited 
without saying a word to each other. Hermione was 
trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories 
chased each other around Harry’s brain, each more 
feeble than the last. He couldn’t see how they were 
going to get out of trouble this time. They were 
cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to 
forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that 
Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out 
of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of 
night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, 
which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add 
Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as 
well be packing their bags already. 

Had Harry thought that things couldn’t have been 
worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall 
appeared, she was leading Neville. 



Page | 272 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



“Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment he saw the 
other two. “I was trying to find you to warn you, I 
heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he 
said you had a drag — ” 

Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but 
Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more 
likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over 
the three of them. 

“I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch 
says you were up in the Astronomy Tower. It’s one 
o’clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.” 

It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to 
answer a teacher’s question. She was staring at her 
slippers, as still as a statue. 

“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” 
said Professor McGonagall. “It doesn’t take a genius 
to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and- 
bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed 
and into trouble. I’ve already caught him. I suppose 
you think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the 
story and believed it, too?” 

Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell him 
without words that this wasn’t true, because Neville 
was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering 
Neville — Harry knew what it must have cost him to 
try and find them in the dark, to warn them. 

“I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall. “Four 
students out of bed in one night! I’ve never heard of 
such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you 
had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought 
Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of 
you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. 
Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk

around school at night, especially these days, it’s very 
dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from 
Gryffindor.” 

“Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the 
lead he’d won in the last Quidditch match. 

“Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, 
breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose. 

“Professor — please — ” 

“You can’t—” 

“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. Now get 
back to bed, all of you. I’ve never been more ashamed 
of Gryffindor students.” 

A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in 
last place. In one night, they’d ruined any chance 
Gryffindor had had for the House Cup. Harry felt as 
though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. 
How could they ever make up for this? 

Harry didn’t sleep all night. He could hear Neville 
sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. 
Harry couldn’t think of anything to say to comfort 
him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the 
dawn. What would happen when the rest of 
Gryffindor found out what they’d done? 

At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses 
that recorded the House points the next day thought 
there ’d been a mistake. How could they suddenly 
have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? 
And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, 
the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch 
matches, had lost them all those points, him and a 
couple of other stupid first years. 

Page | 274 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




From being one of the most popular and admired 
people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most 
hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on 
him, because everyone had been longing to see 
Slytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harry 
went, people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower their 
voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other 
hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and 
cheering, “Thanks Potter, we owe you one!” 

Only Ron stood by him. 

“They’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George 
have lost loads of points in all the time they’ve been 
here, and people still like them.” 

“They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one 
go, though, have they?” said Harry miserably. 

“Well — no,” Ron admitted. 

It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry 
swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren’t 
his business from now on. He’d had it with sneaking 
around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that 
he went to Wood and offered to resign from the 
Quidditch team. 

“Resign?” Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? 

How are we going to get any points back if we can’t 
win at Quidditch?” 

But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the 
team wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if 
they had to speak about him, they called him “the 
Seeker.” 

Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn’t 
have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren’t as 

Page | 275 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. 
Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in 
class, keeping her head down and working in silence. 

Harry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far 
away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off 
his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to 
themselves, working late into the night, trying to 
remember the ingredients in complicated potions, 
learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates 
of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions. ... 

Then, about a week before the exams were due to 
start, Harry’s new resolution not to interfere in 
anything that didn’t concern him was put to an 
unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his 
own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering 
from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he 
heard Quirrell’s voice. 

“No — no — not again, please — ” 

It sounded as though someone was threatening him. 
Harry moved closer. 

“All right — all right — ” he heard Quirrell sob. 

Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the 
classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and 
looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out 
of sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed 
him. He waited until Quirrell’s footsteps had 
disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was 
empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry 
was halfway toward it before he remembered what 
he’d promised himself about not meddling. 

All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s 
Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from 

Page | 276 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking 
with a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to 
have given in at last. 

Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was 
testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he’d 
heard. 

“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told 
him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell — ” 

“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione. 

“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him 
without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the 
thousands of books surrounding them. “I bet there’s a 
book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a 
giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?” 

The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s 
eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could. 

“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done 
ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown 
out for sure.” 

“But we’ve got no proof.” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too 
scared to back us up. Snape’s only got to say he 
doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and 
that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do 
you think they’ll believe, him or us? It’s not exactly a 
secret we hate him, Dumbledore ’ll think we made it 
up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life 
depended on it, he’s too friendly with Snape, and the 
more students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think. 
And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about 
the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.” 

Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn’t. 

Page | 277 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“If we just do a bit of poking around — ” 



“No,” said Harry flatly, “we’ve done enough poking 
around.” 

He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to 
learn the names of its moons. 

The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, 
Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They 
were all the same: 

Your detention will take place at eleven o’clock 
tonight. 

Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall. 

Professor M. McGonagall 

Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in 
the furor over the points they’d lost. He half expected 
Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of 
studying lost, but she didn’t say a word. Like Harry, 
she felt they deserved what they’d got. 

At eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron 
in the common room and went down to the entrance 
hall with Neville. Filch was already there — and so 
was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had 
gotten a detention, too. 

“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading 
them outside. 

“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule 
again, won’t you, eh?” he said, leering at them. “Oh 
yes . . . hard work and pain are the best teachers if you 
ask me. ... It’s just a pity they let the old 
punishments die out . . . hang you by your wrists from 
Page | 278 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




the ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in 
my office, keep ’em well oiled in case they’re ever 
needed. ... Right, off we go, and don’t think of running 
off, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.” 

They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville 
kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment 
was going to be. It must be something really horrible, 
or Filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted. 

The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it 
kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry 
could see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut. Then 
they heard a distant shout. 

“Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.” 

Harry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working 
with Hagrid it wouldn’t be so bad. His relief must 
have showed in his face, because Filch said, “I 
suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with 
that oaf? Well, think again, boy — it’s into the forest 
you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come 
out in one piece.” 

At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy 
stopped dead in his tracks. 

“The forest?” he repeated, and he didn’t sound quite 
as cool as usual. “We can’t go in there at night — 
there’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I 
heard.” 

Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a 
choking noise. 

“That’s your problem, isn’t it?” said Filch, his voice 
cracking with glee. “Should’ve thought of them 
werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t you?” 

Page | 279 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, 
Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, 
and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder. 

“Abou’ time,” he said. “I bin waitin’ fer half an hour 
already. All right, Harry, Hermione?” 

“I shouldn’t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,” said 
Filch coldly, “they’re here to be punished, after all.” 

“That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at 
Filch. “Bin lecturin’ them, eh? ’Snot your place ter do 
that. Yeh’ve done yer bit, I’ll take over from here.” 

“I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of 
them,” he added nastily, and he turned and started 
back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the 
darkness. 

Malfoy now turned to Hagrid. 

“I’m not going in that forest,” he said, and Harry was 
pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice. 

“Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said 
Hagrid fiercely. “Yeh’ve done wrong an’ now yeh’ve got 
ter pay fer it.” 

“But this is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. I 
thought we’d be copying lines or something, if my 
father knew I was doing this, he’d — ” 

“ — tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,” Hagrid 
growled. “Copyin’ lines! What good’s that ter anyone? 
Yeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out. If yeh think 
yer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back 
off ter the castle an’ pack. Go on!” 



Page | 280 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Malfoy didn’t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but 
then dropped his gaze. 

“Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, 

’cause it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ 
I don’ want no one takin’ risks. Follow me over here a 
moment.” 

He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his 
lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding 
earth track that disappeared into the thick black 
trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked 
into the forest. 

“Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on 
the ground? Silvery stuff? That’s unicorn blood. 
There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. 
This is the second time in a week. I found one dead 
last Wednesday. We’re gonna try an’ find the poor 
thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.” 

“And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us 
first?” said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his 
voice. 

“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh 
if yer with me or Fang,” said Hagrid. “An’ keep ter the 
path. Right, now, we’re gonna split inter two parties 
an’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. There’s blood 
all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around 
since last night at least.” 

“I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s 
long teeth. 

“All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said Hagrid. 
“So me, Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, 
Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the other. Now, if any of us 
finds the unicorn, we’ll send up green sparks, right? 

Page | 281 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Get yer wands out an’ practice now — that’s it — an’ 
if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll 
all come an’ find yeh — so, be careful — let’s go.” 

The forest was black and silent. A little way into it 
they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, 
Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, 
Neville, and Fang took the right. 

They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. 
Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the 
branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the 
fallen leaves. 

Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried. 

“ Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry 
asked. 

“Not fast enough,” said Hagrid. “It’s not easy ter catch 
a unicorn, they’re powerful magic creatures. I never 
knew one ter be hurt before.” 

They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could 
hear running water; there must be a stream 
somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn 
blood here and there along the winding path. 

“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don’ 
worry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ 
then well be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!” 

Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them 
off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an 
arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready 
to fire. The three of them listened. Something was 
slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a 
cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting 



Page | 282 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound 
faded away. 

“I knew it,” he murmured. “There’s summat in here 
that shouldn’ be.” 

“A werewolf?” Harry suggested. 

“That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn, 
neither,” said Hagrid grimly. “Right, follow me, but 
careful, now.” 

They walked more slowly, ears straining for the 
faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, 
something definitely moved. 

“Who’s there?” Hagrid called. “Show yerself — I’m 
armed!” 

And into the clearing came — was it a man, or a 
horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, 
but below that was a horse’s gleaming chestnut body 
with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione’s jaws 
dropped. 

“Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid in relief. “How are 
yeh?” 

He walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand. 

“Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan. He had a 
deep, sorrowful voice. “Were you going to shoot me?” 

“Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting his 
crossbow. “There’s summat bad loose in this forest. 
This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione Granger, by the 
way. Students up at the school. An’ this is Ronan, 
you two. He’s a centaur.” 



Page | 283 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly. 



“Good evening,” said Ronan. “Students, are you? And 
do you learn much, up at the school?” 

“Erm — ” 

“A bit,” said Hermione timidly. 

“A bit. Well, that’s something.” Ronan sighed. He 
flung back his head and stared at the sky. “Mars is 
bright tonight.” 

“Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too. “Listen, I’m glad 
we’ve run inter yeh, Ronan, ’cause there’s a unicorn 
bin hurt — you seen anythin’?” 

Ronan didn’t answer immediately. He stared 
unblinkingly upward, then sighed again. 

“Always the innocent are the first victims,” he said. 

“So it has been for ages past, so it is now.” 

“Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’, 
Ronan? Anythin’ unusual?” 

“Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while 
Hagrid watched him impatiently. “Unusually bright.” 

“Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit 
nearer home,” said Hagrid. “So yeh haven’t noticed 
anythin’ strange?” 

Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he 
said, “The forest hides many secrets.” 

A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid 
raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, 

Page | 284 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than 
Ronan. 



“Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid. “All right?” 

“Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?” 

“Well enough. Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you 
seen anythin’ odd in here lately? There’s a unicorn 
bin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?” 

Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked 
skyward. 

“Mars is bright tonight,” he said simply. 

“We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either of 
you do see anythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be 
off, then.” 

Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, 
staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until 
the trees blocked their view. 

“Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight 
answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not 
interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.” 

“Are there many of them in here?” asked Hermione. 

“Oh, a fair few. . . . Keep themselves to themselves 
mostly, but they’re good enough about turnin’ up if 
ever I want a word. They’re deep, mind, centaurs ... 
they know things ... jus’ don’ let on much.” 

“D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” 
said Harry. 



Page | 285 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask 
me, that was what’s bin killin’ the unicorns — never 
heard anythin’ like it before.” 

They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry 
kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the 
nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very 
glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. 
They had just passed a bend in the path when 
Hermione grabbed Hagrid ’s arm. 

“Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!” 

“You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay on the 
path, I’ll come back for yeh!” 

They heard him crashing away through the 
undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very 
scared, until they couldn’t hear anything but the 
rustling of leaves around them. 

“You don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?” 
whispered Hermione. 

“I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got 
Neville ... it’s our fault he’s here in the first place.” 

The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper 
than usual. Harry’s seemed to be picking up every 
sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going 
on? Where were the others? 

At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s 
return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. 
Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked 
up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville 
had panicked and sent up the sparks. 



Page | 286 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Well be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket 
you two were makin’. Right, we’re changin’ groups — 
Neville, you stay with me an’ Hermione, Harry, you go 
with Fang an’ this idiot. I’m sorry,” Hagrid added in a 
whisper to Harry, “but he’ll have a harder time 
frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.” 

So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with 
Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an 
hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path 
became almost impossible to follow because the trees 
were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be 
getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a 
tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing 
around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing 
ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient 
oak. 

“Look — ” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop 
Malfoy. 

Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. 
They inched closer. 

It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry 
had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its 
long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where 
it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on 
the dark leaves. 

Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering 
sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on 
the edge of the clearing quivered. ... Then, out of the 
shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the 
ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and 
Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the 
unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the 
animals side, and began to drink its blood. 



Page | 287 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“AAAAAAAAAAARGH ! ” 



Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did 
Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked 
right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling down its 
front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry 
— he couldn’t move for fear. 

Then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his 
head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half 
blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves 
behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean 
over Harry, charging at the figure. 

The pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his 
knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he 
looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was 
standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one 
looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a 
palomino body. 

“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to 
his feet. 

“Yes — thank you — what was that?” 

The centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue 
eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at 
Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, 
livid, on Harry’s forehead. 

“You are the Potter boy,” he said. “You had better get 
back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time — 
especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker 
this way. 

“My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered 
himself on to his front legs so that Harry could 
clamber onto his back. 

Page | 288 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from 
the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came 
bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and 
sweaty. 

“Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You 
have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are 
you a common mule?” 

“Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the 
Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the 
better.” 

“What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. 
“Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set 
ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what 
is to come in the movements of the planets?” 

Ronan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze 
thought he was acting for the best,” he said in his 
gloomy voice. 

Bane kicked his back legs in anger. 

“For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs 
are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not 
our business to run around like donkeys after stray 
humans in our forest!” 

Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, 
so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on. 

“Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at 
Bane. “Do you not understand why it was killed? Or 
have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set 
myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, 
yes, with humans alongside me if I must.” 



Page | 289 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on 
as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, 
leaving Ronan and Bane behind them. 

Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on. 

“Why’s Bane so angry?” he asked. “What was that 
thing you saved me from, anyway?” 

Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his 
head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did 
not answer Harry’s question. They made their way 
through the trees in silence for so long that Harry 
thought Firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore. 
They were passing through a particularly dense patch 
of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped. 

“Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is 
used for?” 

“No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We’ve 
only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.” 

“That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a 
unicorn,” said Firenze. “Only one who has nothing to 
lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a 
crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even 
if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. 
You have slain something pure and defenseless to 
save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a 
cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your 
lips.” 

Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was 
dappled silver in the moonlight. 

“But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If 
you’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t 
it?” 

Page | 290 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay 
alive long enough to drink something else — 
something that will bring you back to full strength 
and power — something that will mean you can never 
die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the 
school at this very moment?” 

“The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! 
But I don’t understand who — ” 

“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years 
to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting 
their chance?” 

It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly 
around Harry’s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, 
he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told 
him on the night they had met: “Some say he died. 
Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough 
human left in him to die.” 

“Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was VoZ — ” 

“Harry! Harry, are you all right?” 

Hermione was running toward them down the path, 
Hagrid puffing along behind her. 

“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was 
saying. “The unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, it’s in that 
clearing back there.” 

“This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as 
Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. “You are 
safe now.” 

Harry slid off his back. 



Page | 291 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets 
have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. 
I hope this is one of those times.” 

He turned and cantered back into the depths of the 
forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him. 

Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, 
waiting for them to return. He shouted something 
about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him 
awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide- 
eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what 
had happened in the forest. 

Harry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in 
front of the fire. He was still shaking. 

“Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort ... and 
Voldemort’s waiting in the forest ... and all this time 
we thought Snape just wanted to get rich. ...” 

“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified 
whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them. 

Harry wasn’t listening. 

“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so. ... 
Bane was furious ... he was talking about interfering 
with what the planets say is going to happen. ... They 
must show that Voldemort’s coming back. ... Bane 
thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. ... I 
suppose that’s written in the stars as well.” 

“Will you stop saying the name\” Ron hissed. 

“So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the 
Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will 
be able to come and finish me off. ... Well, I suppose 
Bane 11 be happy.”

Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word 
of comfort. 

“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one 
You-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore 
around, You-Know-Who won’t touch you. Anyway, 
who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like 
fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says 
that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.” 

The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. 
They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But 
the night’s surprises weren’t over. 

When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his 
Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them. 
There was a note pinned to it: 

Just in case.

THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR 

In years to come, Harry would never quite remember 
how he had managed to get through his exams when 
he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through 
the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and 
there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and 
well behind the locked door. 

It was sweltering hot, especially in the large 
classroom where they did their written papers. They 
had been given special, new quills for the exams, 
which had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating 
spell. 

They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick 
called them one by one into his class to see if they 
could make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk. 
Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse 
into a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the 
snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. 
Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their 
necks while they tried to remember how to make a 
Forgetfulness potion. 

Page | 294 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the 
stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been 
bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. 
Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves 
because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that 
Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except 
that it was now worse than ever because there was a 
hooded figure dripping blood in it. 

Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry 
had seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have 
scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and 
Hermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as 
Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, 
but he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they 
were so busy with their studying they didn’t have 
much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else 
might be up to. 

Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour 
of answering questions about batty old wizards who’d 
invented self-stirring cauldrons and they’d be free, 
free for a whole wonderful week until their exam 
results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns 
told them to put down their quills and roll up their 
parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the 
rest. 

“That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said 
Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto 
the sunny grounds. “I needn’t have learned about the 
1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of 
Elfric the Eager.” 

Hermione always liked to go through their exam 
papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, 
so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under 
a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were 



Page | 295 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was 
basking in the warm shallows. 



“No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching 
out on the grass. “You could look more cheerful, 

Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly 
we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” 

Harry was rubbing his forehead. 

“I wish I knew what this means\” he burst out angrily. 
“My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but 
never as often as this.” 

“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested. 

“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning ... it 
means danger’s coming. ...” 

Ron couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot. 

“Harry, relax, Hermione ’s right, the Stone’s safe as 
long as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never 
had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. 
He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to 
try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch 
for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” 

Harry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking 
feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, 
something important. When he tried to explain this, 
Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last 
night and was halfway through my Transfiguration 
notes before I remembered we’d done that one.” 

Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have 
anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl 
flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a 
note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one 

Page | 296 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray 
Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to 
get past Fluffy . . . never . . . but — 

Harry suddenly jumped to his feet. 

“Where ’re you going?” said Ron sleepily. 

“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had 
turned white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.” 

“Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. 

“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, 
scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagrid 
wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a 
stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in 
his pocket? How many people wander around with 
dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they 
found Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it 
before?” 

“What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, 
sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t 
answer. 

Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; 
his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was 
shelling peas into a large bowl. 

“Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got 
time fer a drink?” 

“Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off. 

“No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you 
something. You know that night you won Norbert? 
What did the stranger you were playing cards with 
look like?” 

Page | 297 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Dunno said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his 
cloak off.” 



He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his 
eyebrows. 

“It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in 
the Hog’s Head — that’s one o’ the pubs down in the 
village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? I 
never saw his face, he kept his hood up.” 

Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. 

“What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you 
mention Hogwarts at all?” 

“Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried 
to remember. “Yeah ... he asked what I did, an’ I told 
him I was gamekeeper here. ... He asked a bit about 
the sorta creatures I look after ... so I told him ... an’ I 
said what I’d always really wanted was a dragon ... 
an’ then ... I can’ remember too well, ’cause he kept 
buyin’ me drinks. ... Let’s see ... yeah, then he said he 
had the dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I 
wanted . . . but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he 
didn’ want it ter go ter any old home. ... So I told him, 
after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. ...” 

“And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy?” 

Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. 

“Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh 
meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a 
piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’ 
play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter 
sleep — ” 

Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. 

Page | 298 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I 
said it! Hey — where’re yeh goin’?” 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other 
at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, 
which seemed very cold and gloomy after the 
grounds. 

“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid 
told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was 
either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it 
must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just 
hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us 
up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s Dumbledore’s 
office?” 

They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign 
pointing them in the right direction. They had never 
been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know 
anyone who had been sent to see him. 

“Well just have to — ” Harry began, but a voice 
suddenly rang across the hall. 

“What are you three doing inside?” 

It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of 
books. 

“We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said 
Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. 

“See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall 
repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to 
want to do. “Why?” 

Harry swallowed — now what? 



Page | 299 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he 
hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils 
flared. 

“Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said 
coldly. “He received an urgent owl from the Ministry 
of Magic and flew off for London at once.” 

“He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now?” 

“Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, 
he has many demands on his time — ” 

“But this is important.” 

“Something you have to say is more important than 
the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” 

“Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, 
“Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” 

Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it 
wasn’t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out 
of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up. 

“How do you know — ?” she spluttered. 

“Professor, I think — I know — that Sn — that 
someone’s going to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to 
talk to Professor Dumbledore.” 

She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. 

“Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she 
said finally. “I don’t know how you found out about 
the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal 
it, it’s too well protected.” 

“But Professor — ” 

Page | 300 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said 
shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen 
books. “I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy 
the sunshine.” 

But they didn’t. 

“It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor 
McGonagall was out of earshot. “Snape’s going 
through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out 
everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore 
out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of 
Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns 
up.” 

“But what can we — ” 

Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. 
Snape was standing there. 

“Good afternoon,” he said smoothly. 

They stared at him. 

“You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, 
with an odd, twisted smile. 

“We were — ” Harry began, without any idea what he 
was going to say. 

“You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging 
around like this, people will think you’re up to 
something. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose 
any more points, can it?” 

Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape 
called them back. 



Page | 301 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings 
and I will personally make sure you are expelled. 

Good day to you.” 

He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. 

Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. 

“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered 
urgently. “One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape 
— wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he 
leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.” 

“Why me?” 

“It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be 
waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” He put on a 
high voice, “ ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I 
think I got question fourteen b wrong. . . . ’ ” 

“Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go 
and watch out for Snape. 

“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” 
Harry told Ron. “Come on.” 

But that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had 
they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest 
of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up 
again and this time, she lost her temper. 

“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a 
pack of enchantments!” she stormed. “Enough of this 
nonsense! If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here 
again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! 

Yes, Weasley, from my own House!” 

Harry and Ron went back to the common room. Harry 
had just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” 

Page | 302 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and 
Hermione came in. 

“I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and 
asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for 
Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I’ve only 
just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.” 

“Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said. 

The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes 
were glittering. 

“I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and 
get to the Stone first.” 

“You’re mad!” said Ron. 

“You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall 
and Snape have said? You’ll be expelled!” 

“SO WHAT?” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? 
If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming 
back! Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was 
trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to 
get expelled from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a 
school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter 
anymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you 
and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House 
Cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, 
I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for 
Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later 
than I would have, because I’m never going over to 
the Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor 
tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! 
Voldemort killed my parents, remember?” 

He glared at them. 



Page | 303 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“You’re right, Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice. 



“I’ll use the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just 
lucky I got it back.” 

“But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron. 

“All — all three of us?” 

“Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go 
alone?” 

“Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you 
think you’d get to the Stone without us? I’d better go 
and look through my books, there might be 
something useful. ...” 

“But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.” 

“Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick 
told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve 
percent on his exam. They’re not throwing me out 
after that.” 

After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in 
the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of 
the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any 
more, after all. This was the first night he hadn’t been 
upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her 
notes, hoping to come across one of the 
enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry 
and Ron didn’t talk much. Both of them were 
thinking about what they were about to do. 

Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. 

“Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan 
finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran 
upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the 

Page | 304 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had 
given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on 
Fluffy — he didn’t feel much like singing. 

He ran back down to the common room. 

“We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it 
covers all three of us — if Filch spots one of our feet 
wandering along on its own — ” 

“What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of 
the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, 
clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he’d 
been making another bid for freedom. 

“Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly 
putting the cloak behind his back. 

Neville stared at their guilty faces. 

“You’re going out again,” he said. 

“No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, we’re not. Why don’t 
you go to bed, Neville?” 

Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. 
They couldn’t afford to waste any more time, Snape 
might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. 

“You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught 
again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” 

“You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is 
important.” 

But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do 
something desperate. 



Page | 305 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in 
front of the portrait hole. “I’ll — I’ll fight you!” 

“Neville,” Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and 
don’t be an idiot — ” 

“Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. “I don’t 
think you should be breaking any more rules! And 
you were the one who told me to stand up to people!” 

“Yes, but not to us,” said Ron in exasperation. 

“Neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.” 

He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the 
toad, who leapt out of sight. 

“Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his 
fists. “I’m ready!” 

Harry turned to Hermione. 

“Do something,” he said desperately. 

Hermione stepped forward. 

“Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.” 
She raised her wand. 

“Petrificus Totalusl” she cried, pointing it at Neville. 

Neville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang 
together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he 
stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. 

Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville’s jaws were 
jammed together so he couldn’t speak. Only his eyes 
were moving, looking at them in horror. 



Page | 306 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered. 



“It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. 
“Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.” 

“We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry. 

“You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they 
stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak. 

But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t 
feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, 
every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every distant 
breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on 
them. 

At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. 
Norris skulking near the top. 

“Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in 
Harry’s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they 
climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her 
lamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything. 

They didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the 
staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing 
halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would 
trip. 

“Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed 
toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. 
“Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you. Are you 
ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?” 

He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at 
them. 

“Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping 
around unseen.” 

Page | 307 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry had a sudden idea. 



“Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody 
Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.” 

Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught 
himself in time and hovered about a foot off the 
stairs. 

“So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,” he said 
greasily. “My mistake, my mistake — I didn’t see you 
— of course I didn’t, you’re invisible — forgive old 
Peevsie his little joke, sir.” 

“I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay 
away from this place tonight.” 

“I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up 
in the air again. “Hope your business goes well, 

Baron, I’ll not bother you.” 

And he scooted off. 

“Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron. 

A few seconds later, they were there, outside the 
third-floor corridor — and the door was already ajar. 

“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s 
already got past Fluffy.” 

Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress 
upon all three of them what was facing them. 
Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two. 

“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. 
“You can take the cloak, I won’t need it now.” 

“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron. 

Page | 308 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“We’re coming,” said Hermione. 

Harry pushed the door open. 

As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their 
ears. All three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their 
direction, even though it couldn’t see them. 

“What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered. 

“Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it 
there.” 

“It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said 
Harry. “Well, here goes ...” 

He put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t 
really a tune, but from the first note the beast’s eyes 
began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the 
dog’s growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell 
to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast 
asleep. 

“Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out 
of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They 
could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they 
approached the giant heads. 

“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, 
peering over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, 
Hermione?” 

“No, I don’t!” 

“All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully 
over the dog’s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the 
trapdoor, which swung up and open. 

“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously. 

Page | 309 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing 
down, we’ll just have to drop.” 

Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to 
get his attention and pointed at himself. 

“You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I 
don’t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to 
Hermione so she can keep him asleep.” 

Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ 
silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the 
moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its 
deep sleep. 

Harry climbed over it and looked down through the 
trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. 

He lowered himself through the hole until he was 
hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at 
Ron and said, “If anything happens to me, don’t 
follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to 
Dumbledore, right?” 

“Right,” said Ron. 

“See you in a minute, I hope. ...” 

And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as 
he fell down, down, down and — 

FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he 
landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, 
his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he 
was sitting on some sort of plant. 

“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a 
postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, “it’s a 
soft landing, you can jump!” 

Page | 310 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to 
Harry. 

“What’s this stuff?” were his first words. 

“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here 
to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!” 

The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark 
from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She 
landed on Harry’s other side. 

“We must be miles under the school,” she said. 

“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron. 

“Lucky\” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!” 

She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She 
had to struggle because the moment she had landed, 
the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils 
around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs 
had already been bound tightly in long creepers 
without their noticing. 

Hermione had managed to free herself before the 
plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in 
horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off 
them, but the more they strained against it, the 
tighter and faster the plant wound around them. 

“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what 
this is — it’s Devil’s Snare!” 

“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a 
great help,” snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop 
the plant from curling around his neck. 



Page | 311 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Shut up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said 
Hermione. 

“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, 
wrestling with it as it curled around his chest. 

“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare ... what did Professor 
Sprout say? — it likes the dark and the damp — ” 

“So light a fire!” Harry choked. 

“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione 
cried, wringing her hands. 

“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A 
WITCH OR NOT?” 

“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her 
wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of 
the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at 
the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it 
loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light 
and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself 
from their bodies, and they were able to pull free. 

“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” 
said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat 
off his face. 

“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his 
head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” 

“This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone 
passageway, which was the only way forward. 

All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the 
gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The 
passageway sloped downward, and Harry was 
reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the 

Page | 312 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




heart, he remembered the dragons said to be 
guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a 
dragon, a fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad 
enough ... 

“Can you hear something?” Ron whispered. 

Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to 
be coming from up ahead. 

“Do you think it’s a ghost?” 

“I don’t know ... sounds like wings to me.” 

“There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.” 

They reached the end of the passageway and saw 
before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling 
arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel- 
bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the 
room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a 
heavy wooden door. 

“Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” 
said Ron. 

“Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious, 
but I suppose if they all swooped down at once . . . 
well, there’s no other choice ... I’ll run.” 

He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, 
and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel 
sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, 
but nothing happened. He reached the door 
untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. 

The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved 
at the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when 
Hermione tried her Alohomora Charm. 

Page | 313 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Now what?” said Ron. 



“These birds ... they can’t be here just for decoration,” 
said Hermione. 

They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering — 
glittering? 

“They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “They’re 
keys\ Winged keys — look carefully. So that must 
mean ...” he looked around the chamber while the 
other two squinted up at the flock of keys. "... yes — 
look! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the 
door!” 

“But there are hundreds of them!” 

Ron examined the lock on the door. 

“We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably 
silver, like the handle.” 

They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the 
air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They 
grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted 
and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to 
catch one. 

Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest 
Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting 
things other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving 
about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he 
noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it 
had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the 
keyhole. 

“That one!” he called to the others. “That big one — 
there — no, there — with bright blue wings — the 
feathers are all crumpled on one side.” 

Page | 314 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was 
pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off 
his broom. 

“We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking 
his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. “Ron, you 
come at it from above — Hermione, stay below and 
stop it from going down — and I’ll try and catch it. 
Right, NOW!” 

Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key 
dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped 
toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a 
nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone 
with one hand. Ron and Hermione ’s cheers echoed 
around the high chamber. 

They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the 
key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock 
and turned — it worked. The moment the lock had 
clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very 
battered now that it had been caught twice. 

“Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the 
door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. 

The next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see 
anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light 
suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing 
sight. 

They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, 
behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than 
they were and carved from what looked like black 
stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were 
the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered 
slightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces. 

“Now what do we do?” Harry whispered. 

Page | 315 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our 
way across the room.” 



Behind the white pieces they could see another door. 

“How?” said Hermione nervously. 

“I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be 
chessmen.” 

He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out 
to touch the knights horse. At once, the stone sprang 
to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight 
turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron. 

“Do we — er — have to join you to get across?” 

The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other 
two. 

“This needs thinking about. ...” he said. “I suppose 
we’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces. 



Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron 
think. Finally he said, “Now, don’t be offended or 
anything, but neither of you are that good at chess — 



“We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us 
what to do.” 

“Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and 
Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.” 

“What about you?” 

“I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron. 

Page | 316 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because 
at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned 
their backs on the white pieces and walked off the 
board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, 
and Hermione took. 

“White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering 
across the board. “Yes ... look ...” 

A white pawn had moved forward two squares. 

Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved 
silently wherever he sent them. Harry’s knees were 
trembling. What if they lost? 

“Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.” 

Their first real shock came when their other knight 
was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor 
and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite 
still, facedown. 

“Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. 
“Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go 
on.” 

Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces 
showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp 
black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only 
just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in 
danger. He himself darted around the board, taking 
almost as many white pieces as they had lost black 
ones. 

“We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me 
think — let me think ...” 

The white queen turned her blank face toward him. 



Page | 317 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes ...” said Ron softly, “it’s the only way ... I’ve got 
to be taken.” 



“NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted. 

“That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make 
some sacrifices! I make my move and she’ll take me — 
that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!” 

“But — ” 

“Do you want to stop Snape or not?” 

“Ron — ” 

“Look, if you don’t hurry up, hell already have the 
Stone!” 

There was no alternative. 

“Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. 
“Here I go — now, don’t hang around once you’ve 
won.” 

He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. 
She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone 
arm, and he crashed to the floor — Hermione 
screamed but stayed on her square — the white 
queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he’d 
been knocked out. 

Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. 

The white king took off his crown and threw it at 
Harry’s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and 
bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last 
desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione 
charged through the door and up the next 
passageway. 

Page | 318 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“What if he’s — ?” 



“He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince 
himself. “What do you reckon’s next?” 

“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; 
Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall 
transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that 
leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s ...” 

They had reached another door. 

“All right?” Harry whispered. 

“Go on.” 

Harry pushed it open. 

A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of 
them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes 
watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a 
troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out 
cold with a bloody lump on its head. 

“I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry 
whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its 
massive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.” 

He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly 
daring to look at what came next — but there was 
nothing very frightening in here, just a table with 
seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a 
line. 

“Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?” 

They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a 
fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn’t 
ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same 

Page | 319 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading 
onward. They were trapped. 

“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to 
the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it: 

Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, 

Two of us will help you, whichever you would find, 

One among us seven will let you move ahead, 

Another will transport the drinker back instead, 

Two among our number hold only nettle wine, 

Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line. 

Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, 

To help you in your choice, we give you these clues 
four: 

First, however slyly the poison tries to hide 

You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side; 

Second, different are those who stand at either end, 

But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; 

Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, 

Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; 

Fourth, the second left and the second on the right 

Are twins once you taste them, though different at first 
sight 

Page | 320 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw 
that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like 
doing. 

“Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic — it’s 
logic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t 
got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever.” 

“But so will we, won’t we?” 

“Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need 
is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; 
two are wine; one will get us safely through the black 
fire, and one will get us back through the purple.” 

“But how do we know which to drink?” 

“Give me a minute.” 

Hermione read the paper several times. Then she 
walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to 
herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her 
hands. 

“Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us 
through the black fire — toward the Stone.” 

Harry looked at the tiny bottle. 

“There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. 
“That’s hardly one swallow.” 

They looked at each other. 

“Which one will get you back through the purple 
flames?” 

Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end 
of the line. 

Page | 321 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and 
get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, 
they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — 
go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to 
Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold 
Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for him, 
really.” 

“But Harry — what if You-Know- Who’s with him?” 

“Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, 
pointing at his scar. “I might get lucky again.” 

Hermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at 
Harry and threw her arms around him. 

“Hermionel” 

“Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.” 

“I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very 
embarrassed, as she let go of him. 

“Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There 
are more important things — friendship and bravery 
and — oh Harry — be carefull” 

“You drink first,” said Harry. “You are sure which is 
which, aren’t you?” 

“Positive,” said Hermione. She took a long drink from 
the round bottle at the end, and shuddered. 

“It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously. 

“No — but it’s like ice.” 

“Quick, go, before it wears off.” 



Page | 322 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Good luck — take care — ” 



“GO!” 

Hermione turned and walked straight through the 
purple fire. 

Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest 
bottle. He turned to face the black flames. 

“Here I come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle 
in one gulp. 

It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He 
put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced 
himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but 
couldn’t feel them — for a moment he could see 
nothing but dark fire — then he was on the other 
side, in the last chamber. 

There was already someone there — but it wasn’t 
Snape. It wasn’t even Voldemort. 



Page | 323 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 






THE MAN WITH TWO FACES 

It was Quirrell. 

“You\” gasped Harry. 

Quirrell smiled. His face wasn’t twitching at all. 

“Me,” he said calmly. “I wondered whether I’d be 
meeting you here, Potter.” 

“But I thought — Snape — ” 

“Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and it wasn’t his usual 
quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. “Yes, 
Severus does seem the type, doesn’t he? So useful to 
have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. 

Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st- 
stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?” 

Harry couldn’t take it in. This couldn’t be true, it 
couldn’t. 

“But Snape tried to kill me!” 

Page | 324 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



“No, no, no. / tried to kill you. Your friend Miss 
Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed 
to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She 
broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds 
and I’d have got you off that broom. I’d have managed 
it before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a 
countercurse, trying to save you.” 

“Snape was trying to save me?” 

“Of course,” said Quirrell coolly. “Why do you think 
he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying 
to make sure I didn’t do it again. Funny, really ... he 
needn’t have bothered. I couldn’t do anything with 
Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought 
Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he 
did make himself unpopular . . . and what a waste of 
time, when after all that, I’m going to kill you tonight.” 

Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin 
air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry. 

“You’re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the 
school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you’d 
seen me coming to look at what was guarding the 
Stone.” 

“ You let the troll in?” 

“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must 
have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back 
there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was 
running around looking for it, Snape, who already 
suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head 
me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat you to 
death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to 
bite Snape ’s leg off properly. 



Page | 325 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this 
interesting mirror.” 

It was only then that Harry realized what was 
standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised. 

“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell 
murmured, tapping his way around the frame. “Trust 
Dumbledore to come up with something like this . . . 
but he’s in London ... I’ll be far away by the time he 
gets back. ...” 

All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell 
talking and stop him from concentrating on the 
mirror. 

“I saw you and Snape in the forest — ” he blurted out. 

“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to 
look at the back. “He was on to me by that time, 
trying to find out how far I’d got. He suspected me all 
along. Tried to frighten me — as though he could, 
when I had Lord Voldemort on my side. ...” 

Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and 
stared hungrily into it. 

“I see the Stone ... I’m presenting it to my master ... 
but where is it?” 

Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but 
they didn’t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving 
his whole attention to the mirror. 

“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.” 

“Oh, he does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes. 
He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you 



Page | 326 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted 
you dead.” 

“But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought 
Snape was threatening you. 

For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across 
Quirrell’s face. 

“Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard to follow my 
master’s instructions — he is a great wizard and I am 
weak — ” 

“You mean he was there in the classroom with you?” 
Harry gasped. 

“He is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I 
met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish 
young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about 
good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong 
I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, 
and those too weak to seek it. ... Since then, I have 
served him faithfully, although I have let him down 
many times. He has had to be very hard on me.” 
Quirrell shivered suddenly. “He does not forgive 
mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from 
Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me 
. . . decided he would have to keep a closer watch on 
me. ...” 

Quirrell’s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering 
his trip to Diagon Alley — how could he have been so 
stupid? He’d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken 
hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron. 

Quirrell cursed under his breath. 

“I don’t understand ... is the Stone inside the mirror? 
Should I break it?” 

Page | 327 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry’s mind was racing. 



What I want more than anything else in the world at 
the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before 
Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see 
my self finding it — which means I’ll see where it’s 
hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing 
what I’m up to? 

He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass 
without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his 
ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell 
ignored him. He was still talking to himself. 

“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help 
me, Master!” 

And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice 
seemed to come from Quirrell himself. 

“Use the boy ... Use the boy ...” 

Quirrell rounded on Harry. 

“Yes — Potter — come here.” 

He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding 
Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet. 

“Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror 
and tell me what you see.” 

Harry walked toward him. 

I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie 
about what I see, that’s all. 

Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in 
the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s 

Page | 328 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the 
mirror, and opened them again. 

He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. 
But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It 
put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood- 
red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its 
pocket — and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy 
drop into his real pocket. Somehow — incredibly — 
he’d gotten the Stone. 

“Well?” said Quirrell impatiently. “What do you see?” 
Harry screwed up his courage. 

“I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,” he 
invented. “I — I’ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.” 

Quirrell cursed again. 

“Get out of the way,” he said. As Harry moved aside, 
he felt the Sorcerer’s Stone against his leg. Dare he 
make a break for it? 

But he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice 
spoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving his lips. 

“He lies ... He lies ...” 

“Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted. “Tell me 
the truth! What did you just see?” 

The high voice spoke again. 

“Let me speak to him ... face-to-face. ...” 

“Master, you are not strong enough!” 

“I have strength enough ... for this. ...” 

Page | 329 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the 
spot. He couldn’t move a muscle. Petrified, he 
watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap 
his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. 
Quirrell’s head looked strangely small without it. 

Then he turned slowly on the spot. 

Harry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a 
sound. Where there should have been a back to 
Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible 
face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with 
glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. 

“Harry Potter ...” it whispered. 

Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs 
wouldn’t move. 

“See what I have become?” the face said. “Mere 
shadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can 
share another’s body . . . but there have always been 
those willing to let me into their hearts and minds. ... 
Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks 
. . . you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the 
forest ... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be 
able to create a body of my own. ... Now ... why don’t 
you give me that Stone in your pocket?” 

So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into 
Harry’s legs. He stumbled backward. 

“Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “Better save your 
own life and join me ... or you’ll meet the same end as 
your parents. ... They died begging me for mercy. ...” 

“LIAR!” Harry shouted suddenly. 



Page | 330 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that 
Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now 
smiling. 

“How touching ...” it hissed. “I always value bravery. 

... Yes, boy, your parents were brave. ... I killed your 
father first, and he put up a courageous fight . . . but 
your mother needn’t have died ... she was trying to 
protect you. ... Now give me the Stone, unless you 
want her to have died in vain.” 

“NEVER!” 

Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort 
screamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harry 
felt Quirrell’s hand close on his wrist. At once, a 
needle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; his 
head felt as though it was about to split in two; he 
yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his 
surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head 
lessened — he looked around wildly to see where 
Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, 
looking at his fingers — they were blistering before his 
eyes. 

“Seize him! SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Voldemort again, 
and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, 
landing on top of him, both hands around Harry’s 
neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding him with 
pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony. 

“Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my 
hands!” 

And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground 
with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, 
bewildered, at his own palms — Harry could see they 
looked burned, raw, red, and shiny. 



Page | 331 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched 
Voldemort. 

Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, 
but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed 
Quirrell’s face — 

“AAAARGH!” 

Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and 
then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch his bare 
skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only 
chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in 
enough pain to stop him from doing a curse. 

Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, 
and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed 
and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s 
head was building — he couldn’t see — he could only 
hear Quirrell’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells 
of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in 
Harry’s own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!” 

He felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew 
all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down ... 
down ... 

Something gold was glinting just above him. The 
Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too 
heavy. 

He blinked. It wasn’t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of 
glasses. How strange. 

He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus 
Dumbledore swam into view above him. 

“Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore. 



Page | 332 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: “Sir! The 
Stone! It was Quirrell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick — 



“Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the 
times,” said Dumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the 
Stone.” 

“Then who does? Sir, I — ” 

“Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me 
thrown out.” 

Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized 
he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed 
with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table 
piled high with what looked like half the candy shop. 

“Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said 
Dumbledore, beaming. “What happened down in the 
dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a 
complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school 
knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George 
Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a 
toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse 
you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be 
very hygienic, and confiscated it.” 

“How long have I been in here?” 

“Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger 
will be most relieved you have come round, they have 
been extremely worried.” 

“But sir, the Stone — ” 

“I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the 
Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it 



Page | 333 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although 
you were doing very well on your own, I must say.” 

“You got there? You got Hermione’s owl?” 

“We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I 
reached London than it became clear to me that the 
place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived 
just in time to pull Quirrell off you — ” 

“It was you.” 

“I feared I might be too late.” 

“You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept him off the 
Stone much longer — ” 

“Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly 
killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid 
it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.” 

“Destroyed?” said Harry blankly. “But your friend — 
Nicolas Flamel — ” 

“Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, 
sounding quite delighted. “You did do the thing 
properly, didn’t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a 
little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.” 

“But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?” 

“They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in 
order and then, yes, they will die.” 

Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on 
Harry’s face. 

“To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, 
but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to 

Page | 334 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well- 
organized mind, death is but the next great 
adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a 
wonderful thing. As much money and life as you 
could want! The two things most human beings would 
choose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a 
knack of choosing precisely those things that are 
worst for them.” 

Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed 
a little and smiled at the ceiling. 

“Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking ... Sir — even if 
the Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who — ” 

“Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper 
name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the 
thing itself.” 

“Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort’s going to try other ways of 
coming back, isn’t he? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has 
he?” 

“No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there 
somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to 
share ... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He 
left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his 
followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while 
you may only have delayed his return to power, it will 
merely take someone else who is prepared to fight 
what seems a losing battle next time — and if he is 
delayed again, and again, why, he may never return 
to power.” 

Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made 
his head hurt. Then he said, “Sir, there are some 
other things I’d like to know, if you can tell me ... 
things I want to know the truth about. ...” 



Page | 335 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and 
terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with 
great caution. However, I shall answer your questions 
unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case 
I beg you 11 forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.” 

“Well ... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother 
because she tried to stop him from killing me. But 
why would he want to kill me in the first place?” 

Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time. 

“Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. 

Not today. Not now. You will know, one day ... put it 
from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older . . . 
I know you hate to hear this . . . when you are ready, 
you will know.” 

And Harry knew it would be no good to argue. 

“But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?” 

“Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing 
Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t 
realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you 
leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign ... to 
have been loved so deeply, even though the person 
who loved us is gone, will give us some protection 
forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, 
greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, 
could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to 
touch a person marked by something so good.” 

Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out 
on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his 
eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, 
Harry said, “And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know 
who sent it to me?” 



Page | 336 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Ah — your father happened to leave it in my 
possession, and I thought you might like it.” 
Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled. “Useful things ... your 
father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens 
to steal food when he was here.” 

“And there’s something else ...” 

“Fire away.” 

“Quirrell said Snape — ” 

“Professor Snape, Harry.” 

“Yes, him — Quirrell said he hates me because he 
hated my father. Is that true?” 

“Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike 
yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did 
something Snape could never forgive.” 

“What?” 

“He saved his life.” 

“What?” 

“Yes ...” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, the way 
people’s minds work, isn’t it? Professor Snape 
couldn’t bear being in your father’s debt. ... I do 
believe he worked so hard to protect you this year 
because he felt that would make him and your father 
even. Then he could go back to hating your father’s 
memory in peace. ...” 

Harry tried to understand this but it made his head 
pound, so he stopped. 

“And sir, there’s one more thing ...” 

Page | 337 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Just the one?” 



“How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?” 

“Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that. It was one of 
my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, 
that’s saying something. You see, only one who 
wanted to find the Stone — find it, but not use it — 
would be able to get it, otherwise they’d just see 
themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My 
brain surprises even me sometimes. ... Now, enough 
questions. I suggest you make a start on these 
sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans! I was 
unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a 
vomit-flavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve 
rather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe 
with a nice toffee, don’t you?” 

He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his 
mouth. Then he choked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!” 

Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but 
very strict. 

“Just five minutes,” Harry pleaded. 

“Absolutely not.” 

“You let Professor Dumbledore in. ...” 

“Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite 
different. You need rest.” 

“I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go 
on, Madam Pomfrey ...” 

“Oh, very well,” she said. “But five minutes only.” 

And she let Ron and Hermione in. 

Page | 338 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Harryl” 



Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him 
again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his 
head was still very sore. 

“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — 
Dumbledore was so worried — ” 

“The whole school’s talking about it,” said Ron. “What 
really happened?” 

It was one of those rare occasions when the true story 
is even more strange and exciting than the wild 
rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the 
mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione 
were a very good audience; they gasped in all the 
right places, and when Harry told them what was 
under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud. 

“So the Stone’s gone?” said Ron finally. “Flamel’s just 
going to die?” 

“That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — 
what was it? — ‘to the well-organized mind, death is 
but the next great adventure.’ ” 

“I always said he was off his rocker,” said Ron, 
looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was. 

“So what happened to you two?” said Harry. 

“Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought 
Ron round — that took a while — and we were 
dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when 
we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew — 
he just said, ‘Harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and 
hurtled off to the third floor.” 

Page | 339 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“D’you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron. 
“Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?” 

“Well,” Hermione exploded, “if he did — I mean to say 
— that’s terrible — you could have been killed.” 

“No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He’s a funny 
man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give 
me a chance. I think he knows more or less 
everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he 
had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and 
instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to 
help. I don’t think it was an accident he let me find 
out how the mirror worked. It’s almost like he thought 
I had the right to face Voldemort if I could. ...” 

“Yeah, Dumbledore’s off his rocker, all right,” said 
Ron proudly. “Listen, you’ve got to be up for the end- 
of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and 
Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last 
Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by 
Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.” 

At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over. 

“You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,” she 
said firmly. 



•k k k 



After a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to 
normal. 

“I want to go to the feast,” he told Madam Pomfrey as 
she straightened his many candy boxes. “I can, can’t 
I?” 



Page | 340 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to 
go,” she said sniffily, as though in her opinion 
Professor Dumbledore didn’t realize how risky feasts 
could be. “And you have another visitor.” 

“Oh, good,” said Harry. “Who is it?” 

Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual 
when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be 
allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at 
him, and burst into tears. 

“It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!” he sobbed, his 
face in his hands. “I told the evil git how ter get past 
Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn’t 
know, an’ I told him! Yeh could’ve died! All fer a 
dragon egg! I’ll never drink again! I should be chucked 
out an’ made ter live as a Muggle!” 

“Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking 
with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into 
his beard. “Hagrid, he’d have found out somehow, 
this is Voldemort we’re talking about, he’d have found 
out even if you hadn’t told him.” 

“Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid. “An’ don’ say the 
name!” 

“VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so 
shocked, he stopped crying. “I’ve met him and I’m 
calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we 
saved the Stone, it’s gone, he can’t use it. Have a 
Chocolate Frog, I’ve got loads. ...” 

Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and 
said, “That reminds me. I’ve got yeh a present.” 

“It’s not a stoat sandwich, is it?” said Harry 
anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. 

Page | 341 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter 
fix it. ’Course, he shoulda sacked me instead — 
anyway, got y eh this ...” 

It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. 
Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard 
photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every 
page were his mother and father. 

“Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, 
askin’ fer photos ... knew yeh didn’ have any ... d’yeh 
like it?” 

Harry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood. 

Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast 
alone that night. He had been held up by Madam 
Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving him one 
last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It 
was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and 
silver to celebrate Slytherin ’s winning the House Cup 
for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing 
the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the 
High Table. 

When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and 
then everybody started talking loudly at once. He 
slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the 
Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that 
people were standing up to look at him. 

Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The 
babble died away. 

“Another year gone!” Dumbledore said cheerfully. 

“And I must trouble you with an old man’s wheezing 
waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious 
feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads 
are all a little fuller than they were . . . you have the 
Page | 342 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty 
before next year starts. ... 

“Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs 
awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, 
Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in 
third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; 
Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and 
Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.” 

A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the 
Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging 
his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight. 

“Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore. 
“However, recent events must be taken into account.” 

The room went very still. The Slytherins’ smiles faded 
a little. 

“Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute 
points to dish out. Let me see. Yes ... 

“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley ...” 

Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish 
with a bad sunburn. 

"... for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has 
seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty 
points.” 

Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; 
the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be 
heard telling the other prefects, “My brother, you 
know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s 
giant chess set!” 

At last there was silence again. 

Page | 343 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of 
cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House 
fifty points.” 

Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly 
suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up 
and down the table were beside themselves — they 
were a hundred points up. 

“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter ...” said Dumbledore. 

The room went deadly quiet. "... for pure nerve and 
outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty 
points.” 

The din was deafening. Those who could add up while 
yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now 
had four hundred and seventy-two points — exactly 
the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the House 
Cup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one 
more point. 

Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell 
silent. 

“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, 
smiling. “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up 
to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our 
friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville 
Longbottom.” 

Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well 
have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, 
so loud was the noise that erupted from the 
Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up 
to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, 
disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He 
had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor 
before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs 
and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more 
Page | 344 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




stunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body-Bind 
Curse put on him. 

“Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of 
applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were 
celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, “we need a little 
change of decoration.” 

He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green 
hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; 
the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering 
Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking 
Professor McGonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced 
smile. He caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once 
that Snape ’s feelings toward him hadn’t changed one 
jot. This didn’t worry Harry. It seemed as though life 
would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it 
ever was at Hogwarts. 

It was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than 
winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out 
mountain trolls ... he would never, ever forget tonight. 

Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results 
were still to come, but come they did. To their great 
surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; 
Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first 
years. Even Neville scraped through, his good 
Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions 
one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as 
stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he 
had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you 
couldn’t have everything in life. 

And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their 
trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking 
in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all 
students, warning them not to use magic over the 
holidays (“I always hope they’ll forget to give us 


these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to 
take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across 
the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; 
talking and laughing as the countryside became 
greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor 
Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off 
their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; 
pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at 
King’s Cross station. 

It took quite a while for them all to get off the 
platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket 
barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and 
threes so they didn’t attract attention by all bursting 
out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles. 

“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, 
“both of you — I’ll send you an owl.” 

“Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look 
forward to.” 

People jostled them as they moved forward toward the 
gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them 
called: 

“Bye, Harry!” 

“See you, Potter!” 

“Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at him. 

“Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry. 

He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway 
together. 

“There he is, Mom, there he is, look!” 

It was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she 
wasn’t pointing at Ron. 

“Harry Potter!” she squealed. “Look, Mom! I can see 
“Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.” 

Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them. 

“Busy year?” she said. 

“Very,” said Harry. “Thanks for the fudge and the 
sweater, Mrs. Weasley.” 

“Oh, it was nothing, dear.” 

“Ready, are you?” 

It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still 
mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, 
carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary 
people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, 
looking terrified at the very sight of Harry. 

“You must be Harry’s family!” said Mrs. Weasley. 

“In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon. “Hurry 
up, boy, we haven’t got all day.” He walked away. 

Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and 
Hermione. 

“See you over the summer, then.” 

“Hope you have — er — a good holiday,” said 
Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, 
shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant. 

Page | 347 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 
“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at 
the grin that was spreading over his face. “ They don’t 
know we’re not allowed to use magic at home. I’m 
going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...” 


Well, thank you very much. This is incredible.

Media will not show the magnitude of this crowd. Even I, when I turned on today, I looked, and I saw thousands of people here. But you don't see hundreds of thousands of people behind you because they don't want to show that.

We have hundreds of thousands of people here and I just want them to be recognized by the fake news media. Turn your cameras please and show what's really happening out here because these people are not going to take it any longer. They're not going to take it any longer. Go ahead. Turn your cameras, please. Would you show? They came from all over the world, actually, but they came from all over our country.

I just really want to see what they do. I just want to see how they covered. I've never seen anything like it. But it would be really great if we could be covered fairly by the media. The media is the biggest problem we have as far as I'm concerned, single biggest problem. The fake news and the Big tech.

Big tech is now coming into their own. We beat them four years ago. We surprised them. We took them by surprise and this year they rigged an election. They rigged it like they've never rigged an election before. And by the way, last night they didn't do a bad job either if you notice.

I'm honest. And I just, again, I want to thank you. It's just a great honor to have this kind of crowd and to be before you and hundreds of thousands of American patriots who are committed to the honesty of our elections and the integrity of our glorious republic.

All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats, which is what they're doing. And stolen by the fake news media. That's what they've done and what they're doing. We will never give up, we will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved.

Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore and that's what this is all about. And to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with: We will stop the steal. Today I will lay out just some of the evidence proving that we won this election and we won it by a landslide. This was not a close election.

You know, I say, sometimes jokingly, but there's no joke about it: I've been in two elections. I won them both and the second one, I won much bigger than the first. OK. Almost 75 million people voted for our campaign, the most of any incumbent president by far in the history of our country, 12 million more people than four years ago.

And I was told by the real pollsters — we do have real pollsters — they know that we were going to do well and we were going to win. What I was told, if I went from 63 million, which we had four years ago, to 66 million, there was no chance of losing. Well, we didn't go to 66, we went to 75 million, and they say we lost. We didn't lose.

And by the way, does anybody believe that Joe had 80 million votes? Does anybody believe that? He had 80 million computer votes. It's a disgrace. There's never been anything like that. You could take third-world countries. Just take a look. Take third-world countries. Their elections are more honest than what we've been going through in this country. It's a disgrace. It's a disgrace.

Even when you look at last night. They're all running around like chickens with their heads cut off with boxes. Nobody knows what the hell is going on. There's never been anything like this.

We will not let them silence your voices. We're not going to let it happen, I'm not going to let it happen.

(Audience chants: "Fight for Trump.")

Thank you.

And I'd love to have if those tens of thousands of people would be allowed. The military, the secret service. And we want to thank you and the police law enforcement. Great. You're doing a great job. But I'd love it if they could be allowed to come up here with us. Is that possible? Can you just let him come up, please?

And Rudy, you did a great job. He's got guts. You know what? He's got guts, unlike a lot of people in the Republican Party. He's got guts. He fights, he fights.

And I'll tell you. Thank you very much, John. Fantastic job. I watched. That's a tough act to follow, those two. John is one of the most brilliant lawyers in the country, and he looked at this and he said, "What an absolute disgrace that this can be happening to our Constitution."

And he looked at Mike Pence, and I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so.

Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election. All he has to do, all this is, this is from the number one, or certainly one of the top, Constitutional lawyers in our country. He has the absolute right to do it. We're supposed to protect our country, support our country, support our Constitution, and protect our constitution.

States want to revote. The states got defrauded. They were given false information. They voted on it. Now they want to recertify. They want it back. All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify and we become president and you are the happiest people.

And I actually, I just spoke to Mike. I said: "Mike, that doesn't take courage. What takes courage is to do nothing. That takes courage." And then we're stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot and we have to live with that for four more years. We're just not going to let that happen.

Many of you have traveled from all across the nation to be here, and I want to thank you for the extraordinary love. That's what it is. There's never been a movement like this, ever, ever. For the extraordinary love for this amazing country, and this amazing movement, thank you.

(Audience chants: "We love Trump.")

By the way, this goes all the way back past the Washington Monument. You believe this? Look at this. That is. Unfortunately gave, they gave the press the prime seats. I can't stand that.

No. But you look at that behind. I wish they'd flip those cameras and look behind you. That is the most amazing sight. When they make a mistake, you get to see it on television. Amazing. Amazing. All the way back.

And don't worry, we will not take the name off the Washington Monument. We will not cancel culture.

You know they wanted to get rid of the Jefferson Memorial. Either take it down or just put somebody else in there. I don't think that's going to happen. It damn well better not. Although, with this administration, if this happens, it could happen. You'll see some really bad things happen.

They'll knock out Lincoln too, by the way. They've been taking his statue down. But then we signed a little law. You hurt our monuments, you hurt our heroes, you go to jail for 10 years, and everything stopped. You notice that? It stopped. It all stopped.

And they could use Rudy back in New York City. Rudy. They could use you. Your city's going to hell. They want Rudy Giuliani back in New York. We'll get a little younger version of Rudy. Is that OK, Rudy?

We're gathered together in the heart of our nation's capital for one very, very basic and simple reason: To save our democracy.

You know most candidates on election evening and, of course, this thing goes on so long. They still don't have any idea what the votes are. We still have congressional seats under review. They have no idea. They've totally lost control. They've used the pandemic as a way of defrauding the people in a proper election.

But you know, you know, when you see this and when you see what's happening. Number one, they all say, "Sir, we'll never let it happen again." I said, "That's good. But what about eight weeks ago?" You know they try and get you to go.

They said, "Sir, in four years, you're guaranteed." I said: "I'm not interested right now. Do me a favor, go back eight weeks. I want to go back eight weeks. Let's go back eight weeks."

We want to go back and we want to get this right because we're going to have somebody in there that should not be in there and our country will be destroyed and we're not going to stand for that.

For years, Democrats have gotten away with election fraud and weak Republicans. And that's what they are. There's so many weak Republicans. And we have great ones. Jim Jordan and some of these guys, they're out there fighting. The House guys are fighting. But it's, it's incredible.

Many of the Republicans, I helped them get in, I helped them get elected. I helped Mitch get elected. I helped. I could name 24 of them, let's say, I won't bore you with it. And then all of a sudden you have something like this. It's like, "Oh gee, maybe I'll talk to the president sometime later." No, it's amazing.

They're weak Republicans, they're pathetic Republicans and that's what happens.

If this happened to the Democrats, there'd be hell all over the country going on. There'd be hell all over the country. But just remember this: You're stronger, you're smarter, you've got more going than anybody. And they try and demean everybody having to do with us. And you're the real people, you're the people that built this nation. You're not the people that tore down our nation.

The weak Republicans, and that's it. I really believe it. I think I'm going to use the term, the weak Republicans. You've got a lot of them. And you got a lot of great ones. But you got a lot of weak ones. They've turned a blind eye, even as Democrats enacted policies that chipped away our jobs, weakened our military, threw open our borders and put America last.

Did you see the other day where Joe Biden said, I want to get rid of the America First policy? What's that all about? Get rid of. How do you say I want to get rid of America First? Even if you're going to do it, don't talk about it, right? Unbelievable what we have to go through. What we have to go through.

And you have to get your people to fight. And if they don't fight, we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don't fight. You primary them. We're going to. We're going to let you know who they are. I can already tell you, frankly.

But this year, using the pretext of the China virus and the scam of mail-in ballots, Democrats attempted the most brazen and outrageous election theft and there's never been anything like this. So pure theft in American history. Everybody knows it.

That election, our election was over at 10 o'clock in the evening. We're leading Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, by hundreds of thousands of votes.

And then late in the evening, or early in the morning, boom, these explosions of bull****.

And all of a sudden. All of a sudden it started to happen.

(Audience chants: "Bull****.")

Don't forget when Romney got beat. Romney, hey. Did you see his? I wonder if he enjoyed his flight in last night. But when Romney got beaten, you know, he stands up like you're more typical, "Well, I'd like to congratulate the victor." The victor? Who is the victor, Mitt? "I'd like to congratulate." They don't go and look at the facts. No, I don't know. He got, he got slaughtered. Probably, maybe it was OK, maybe it was. But that's what happened.

But we look at the facts and our election was so corrupt that in the history of this country we've never seen anything like it. You can go all the way back.

You know, America is blessed with elections. All over the world they talk about our elections. You know what the world says about us now? They said, we don't have free and fair elections.

And you know what else? We don't have a free and fair press. Our media is not free, it's not fair. It suppresses thought, it suppresses speech and it's become the enemy of the people. It's become the enemy of the people. It's the biggest problem we have in this country.

No third-world countries would even attempt to do what we caught them doing. And you'll hear about that in just a few minutes.

Republicans are, Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back. It's like a boxer. And we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. And we're going to have to fight much harder.

And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us, and if he doesn't, that will be a, a sad day for our country because you're sworn to uphold our Constitution.

Now, it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy. And after this, we're going to walk down, and I'll be there with you, we're going to walk down, we're going to walk down.

Anyone you want, but I think right here, we're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.

Because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated.

I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.

Today we will see whether Republicans stand strong for integrity of our elections. But whether or not they stand strong for our country, our country. Our country has been under siege for a long time. Far longer than this four-year period. We've set it on a much greater course. So much, and we, I thought, you know, four more years. I thought it would be easy.

We've created the greatest economy in history. We rebuilt our military. We get you the biggest tax cuts in history. Right? We got you the biggest regulation cuts. There's no president, whether it's four years, eight years or in one case more, got anywhere near the regulation cuts.

Used to take 20 years to get a highway approved, now we're down to two. I want to get it down to one, but we're down to two. And it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons, but we got it down to safety.

We created Space Force, We, we, we. Look at what we did. Our military has been totally rebuilt. So we create Space Force which, by and of itself, is a major achievement for an administration. And with us it's one of so many different things.

Right to Try. Everybody know about Right to Try. We did things that nobody ever thought possible. We took care of our vets, our vets. The VA now has the highest rating, 91%. The highest rating that it's had from the beginning, 91% approval rating. Always, you watch the VA, it was on television every night, people living in a horrible, horrible manner. We got that done. We got accountability done. We got it so that now in the VA, you don't have to wait for four weeks, six weeks, eight weeks, four months to see a doctor. If you can't get a doctor, you go outside, you get the doctor. You have it taken care of and we pay the doctor.

And we've not only made life wonderful for so many people, we've saved tremendous amounts of money, far secondarily, but we've saved a lot of money. And now we have the right to fire bad people in the VA. We had 9,000 people that treated our veterans horribly. In primetime, they would not have treated our veterans badly. But they treated our veterans horribly.

And we have what's called the account, VA Accountability Act. And the accountability says if we see somebody in there that doesn't treat our vets well or they steal, they rob, they do things badly, we say: "Joe you're fired. Get out of here." Before you couldn't do that. You couldn't do that before.

So we've taken care of things, we've done things like nobody's ever thought possible. And that's part of the reason that many people don't like us, because we've done too much.

But we've done it quickly and we were going to sit home and watch a big victory and everybody had us down for a victory. It was going to be great and now we're out here fighting. I said to somebody, I was going to take a few days and relax after our big electoral victory. 10 o'clock it was over. But I was going to take a few days.

And I can say this. Since our election, I believe, which was such a catastrophe, when I watch. And even these guys knew what happened. They know what happened. They're saying: "Wow, Pennsylvania's insurmountable. Wow, Wisconsin." Look at the big leads we had, right. Even though the press said we would lose Wisconsin by 17 points. Even though the press said, Ohio's going to be close, we set a record; Florida's going to be close, we set a record; Texas is going to be close, Texas is going to be close, we set a record.

And we set a record with Hispanic, with the Black community, we set a record with everybody.

Today we see a very important event though. Because right over there, right there, we see the event going to take place. And I'm going to be watching. Because history is going to be made. We're going to see whether or not we have great and courageous leaders, or whether or not we have leaders that should be ashamed of themselves throughout history, throughout eternity they'll be ashamed.

And you know what? If they do the wrong thing, we should never, ever forget that they did. Never forget. We should never ever forget.

With only three of the seven states in question, we win the presidency of the United States. And by the way, it's much more important today than it was 24 hours ago, because I don't. I spoke to David Perdue, what a great person, and Kelly Loeffler, two great people, but it was a setup.

And you know, I said, "We have no backline anymore." The only backline, the only line of demarcation, the only line that we have is the veto of the president of the United States. So this is now, what we're doing, a far more important election than it was two days ago.

I want to thank the more than 140 members of the House. Those are warriors. They're over there working like you've never seen before. Studying, talking, actually going all the way back, studying the roots of the Constitution, because they know we have the right to send a bad vote that was illegally gotten.

They gave these people bad things to vote for and they voted because what did they know? And then when they found out a few weeks later, again, it took them four years to devise this screen.

And the only unhappy person in the United States, single most unhappy, is Hillary Clinton. Because she said: "Why didn't you do this for me four years ago? Why didn't you do this for me four years ago? Change the votes, 10,000 in Michigan. You could have changed the whole thing." But she's not too happy. You know, you don't see her anymore. What happened? Where's Hillary? Where is she?

But I want to thank all of those congressmen and women. I also want to thank our 13, most courageous members of the U.S. Senate. Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Ron Johnson, Senator Josh Hawley, Kelly Loeffler.

And Kelly Loeffler, I'll tell you, she has been, she's been so great. She worked so hard. So let's give her and David a little special hand because it was rigged against them. Let's give her and David.

Kelly Loeffler, David Purdue. They fought a good race. They never had a shot. That equipment should never have been allowed to be used, and I was telling these people don't let him use this stuff.

Marsha Blackburn, terrific person. Mike Braun, Indiana. Steve Daines, great guy. Bill Hagerty, John Kennedy, James Lankford, Cynthia Lummis, Tommy Tuberville, the coach, and Roger Marshall. We want to thank them. Senators that stepped up, we want to thank them.

I actually think though, it takes, again, more courage not to step up, and I think a lot of those people are going to find that out and you better start looking at your leadership, because your leadership has led you down the tubes.

You know, we don't want to give $2,000 to people. We want to give them $600. Oh, great. How does that play politically? Pretty good? And this has nothing to do with politics, but how does it play politically?

China destroyed these people. We didn't destroy. China destroy them, totally destroyed them. We want to give them $600 and they just wouldn't change.

I said give them $2,000, we'll pay it back. We'll pay it back fast. You already owe 26 trillion, give them a couple of bucks. Let them live. Give them a couple of bucks. And some of the people here disagree with me on that, but I just say, "Look, you've got to let people live."

And how does that play though? OK. Number one, it's the right thing to do. But how does that play politically? I think it's the primary reason, one of the primary reasons, the other was just pure cheating. That was the primary, super primary reason. But you can't do that, you got to use your head.

As you know, the media has constantly asserted the outrageous lie that there was no evidence of widespread fraud. Have you ever seen these people? While there is no evidence of fraud. Oh, really? Well, I'm going to read you pages. I hope you don't get bored listening to it. Promise? Don't get bored listening to it, all those hundreds of thousands of people back there. Move them up, please, yeah.

All they, all these people, don't get bored, don't get angry at me because you're going to get bored because it's so much.

The American people do not believe the corrupt, fake news anymore. They have ruined their reputation. But you know, it used to be that they'd argue with me. I'd fight. So I'd fight, they'd fight, I'd fight, they'd fight. Pop pop. You'd believe me, you'd believe them. Somebody comes out. You know, they had their point of view, I had my point of view, but you'd have an argument.

Now what they do is they go silent. It's called suppression and that's what happens in a communist country. That's what they do, they suppress. You don't fight with them anymore. Unless it's a bad story. They have a little bad story about me, they make it 10 times worse and it's a major headline.

But Hunter Biden, they don't talk about him. What happened to Hunter? Where's Hunter? Where's Hunter? They don't talk about him. They'll watch, all the sets will go off. Well, they can't do that because they get good ratings. Their ratings are too good. Now, where's Hunter? You know.

And how come Joe is allowed to give a billion dollars of money to get rid of the prosecutor in Ukraine? How does that happen? I'd ask you that question. How does that happen? Can you imagine if I said that? If I said that it would be a whole different ballgame.

And how come Hunter gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow's wife, and gets hundreds of thousands of dollars to sit on an energy board, even though he admits he has no knowledge of energy? And millions of dollars up front.

And how come they go into China and they leave with billions of dollars to manage. "Have you managed money before?" "No, I haven't." "Oh, that's good. Here's about 3 billion." No, they don't talk about that.

No, we have a corrupt media. They've gone silent. They've gone dead. I now realize how good it was if you go back 10 years, I realized how good, even though I didn't necessarily love them, I realized how good. It was like a cleansing motion, right?

But we don't have that anymore. We don't have a fair media anymore. It's suppression. And you have to be very careful with that and they've lost all credibility in this country.

We will not be intimidated into accepting the hoaxes and the lies that we've been forced to believe.

Over the past several weeks, we've amassed overwhelming evidence about a fake election. This is the presidential election. Last night was a little bit better because of the fact that we had a lot of eyes watching one specific state, but they cheated like hell anyway.

You have one of the dumbest governors in the United States. And you know when I endorsed him, and I didn't know this guy, at the request of David Perdue, he said, "Friend of mine's running for governor." "What's his name?" And you know the rest. He was in fourth place, fifth place. I don't know, he was, he was doing poorly. I endorse him, he went like a rocket ship and he won.

And then I had to beat Stacey Abrams with this guy, Brian Kemp. I had to beat Stacey Abrams. And I had to beat Oprah, used to be a friend of mine. You know, I was on her last show, her last week, she picked the five outstanding people. I don't think she thinks that any more. Once I ran for president, I didn't notice there were too many calls coming in from Oprah. Believe it or not, she used to like me. But I was one of the five outstanding people.

And I had a campaign against Michelle Obama and Barack Hussein Obama, against Stacey.

And I had Brian Kemp, who weighs 130 pounds. He said he played offensive line in football. I'm trying to figure that out. I'm still trying to figure that out. He said that the other night, "I was an offensive lineman." I'm saying: "Really? That must have been a very small team." But I look at that and I look at what's happened and he turned out to be a disaster. This stuff happens.

You know, look, I'm not happy with the Supreme Court. They love to rule against me. I picked three people. I fought like hell for them. One in particular, I fought. They all said, "Sir, cut him loose." He's killing the senators. You know, very loyal senators, they're very loyal people, "Sir, cut him loose, he's killing us, sir, cut him loose." I must have gotten half of the senators.

I said: "No, I can't do that, it's unfair to him and it's unfair to the family. He didn't do anything wrong." They made up stories, they're all made-up stories. He didn't do anything wrong. "Cut him loose, sir." I said, "No, I won't do that. We got him through." And you know what, they couldn't give a damn. They couldn't give a damn. Let him rule the right way.

But it almost seems that they're all going out of their way to hurt all of us and to hurt our country. To hurt our country.

You know, I read a story in one of the newspapers recently how I control the three Supreme Court justices. I control them. They're puppets.

I read it about Bill Barr, that he's my personal attorney. That he'll do anything for me. And I said, "You know, it really is genius." Because what they do is that, and it makes it really impossible for them to ever give you a victory, because all of a sudden Bill Barr changed. If you hadn't noticed. I like Bill Barr, but he changed, because he didn't want to be considered my personal attorney.

And the Supreme Court, they rule against me so much. You know why? Because the story is — I haven't spoken to any of them, any of them, since virtually they got in — but the story is that they're my puppets. Right? That they're puppets.

And now the only way they can get out of that because they hate that it's not good in the social circuit. And the only way they get out is to rule against Trump. So let's rule against Trump. And they do that. So I want to congratulate them.

But it shows you the media's genius. In fact, probably if I was the media, I'd do it the same way. I hate to say it. But we got to get them straightened out.

Today, for the sake of our democracy, for the sake of our Constitution, and for the sake of our children, we lay out the case for the entire world to hear. You want to hear it?

(Audience responds: "Yeah")

In every single swing state, local officials, state officials, almost all Democrats, made illegal and unconstitutional changes to election procedures without the mandated approvals by the state legislatures.

That these changes paved a way for fraud on a scale never seen before. I think we go a long way outside of our country when I say that.

So, just in a nutshell, you can't make a change or voting for a federal election unless the state legislature approves it. No judge can do it. Nobody can do it. Only a legislature.

So as an example, in Pennsylvania, or whatever, you have a Republican legislature, you have a Democrat mayor, and you have a lot of Democrats all over the place. They go to the legislature. The legislature laughs at them, says we're not going to do that. They say, thank you very much and they go and make the changes themselves, they do it anyway. And that's totally illegal. That's totally illegal. You can't do that.

In Pennsylvania, the Democrat secretary of state and the Democrat state Supreme Court justices illegally abolished the signature verification requirements just 11 days prior to the election.

So think of what they did. No longer is there signature verification. Oh, that's OK. We want voter ID by the way. But no longer is there a signature verification. Eleven days before the election they say we don't want it. You know why they don't want to? Because they want to cheat. That's the only reason.

Who would even think of that? We don't want to verify a signature?

There were over 205,000 more ballots counted in Pennsylvania. Think of this, you had 205,000 more ballots than you had voters. That means you had two. Where did they come from? You know where they came from? Somebody's imagination, whatever they needed.

So in Pennsylvania, you had 205,000 more votes than you had voters. And the number is actually much greater than that now. That was as of a week ago. And this is a mathematical impossibility unless you want to say it's a total fraud.

So Pennsylvania was defrauded. Over 8,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were cast by people whose names and dates of birth match individuals who died in 2020 and prior to the election. Think of that. Dead people, lots of dead people, thousands. And some dead people actually requested an application. That bothers me even more.

Not only are they voting, they want an application to vote. One of them was 29 years ago, died. It's incredible. Over 14,000 ballots were cast by out-of-state voters, so these are voters that don't live in this state.

And by the way, these numbers are what they call outcome-determinative, meaning these numbers far surpass. I lost by a very little bit. These numbers are massive, massive.

More than 10,000 votes in Pennsylvania were illegally counted, even though they were received after Election Day. In other words, they were received after Election Day. Let's count them anyway.

And what they did in many cases is, they did fraud. They took the date and they moved it back so that it no longer is after Election Day. And more than 60,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were reported received back. They got back before they were ever supposedly mailed out. In other words, you got the ballot back before you mailed it, which is also logically and logistically impossible, right?

Think of that one. You got the ballot back. Let's send the ballots. Oh, they've already been sent. But we got the ballot back before they were sent. I don't think that's too good, right?

Twenty-five thousand ballots in Pennsylvania were requested by nursing home residents, all in a single giant batch, not legal, indicating an enormous, illegal ballot harvesting operation. You're not allowed to do it, it's against the law.

The day before the election, the state of Pennsylvania reported the number of absentee ballots that had been sent out. Yet this number was suddenly and drastically increased by 400,000 people. It was increased, nobody knows where it came from, by 400,000 ballots, one day after the election.

It remains totally unexplained. They said, "Well, ah, we can't figure that." Now, that's many, many times what it would take to overthrow the state. Just that one element. Four hundred thousand ballots appeared from nowhere right after the election.

By the way, Pennsylvania has now seen all of this. They didn't know because it was so quick. They had a vote. They voted. But now they see all this stuff, it's all come to light. Doesn't happen that fast. And they want to recertify their votes. They want to recertify. But the only way that can happen is if Mike Pence agrees to send it back. Mike Pence has to agree to send it back.

(Audience chants: "Send it back.")

And many people in Congress want it sent back.

And think of what you're doing. Let's say you don't do it. Somebody says, "Well, we have to obey the Constitution." And you are, because you're protecting our country and you're protecting the Constitution. So you are.

But think of what happens. Let's say they're stiffs and they're stupid people, and they say, well, we really have no choice. Even though Pennsylvania and other states want to redo their votes. They want to see the numbers. They already have the numbers. Go very quickly. And they want to redo their legislature because many of these votes were taken, as I said, because it wasn't approved by their legislature. You know, that, in itself, is legal. And then you have the scam, and that's all of the things that we're talking about.

But think of this. If you don't do that, that means you will have a president of the United States for four years, with his wonderful son. You will have a president who lost all of these states. Or you will have a president, to put it another way, who was voted on by a bunch of stupid people who lost all of these states.

You will have an illegitimate president. That's what you'll have. And we can't let that happen.

These are the facts that you won't hear from the fake news media. It's all part of the suppression effort. They don't want to talk about it. They don't want to talk about it. In fact, when I started talking about that, I guarantee you, a lot of the television sets and a lot of those cameras went off. And that's a lot of cameras back there. But a lot of them went off.

But these are the things you don't hear about. You don't hear what you just heard. I'm going to go over a few more states. But you don't hear it by the people who want to deceive you and demoralize you and control you. Big tech, media.

Just like the suppression polls that said we're going lose Wisconsin by 17 points. Well, we won Wisconsin. They don't have it that way because they lost just by a little sliver. But they had me down the day before, Washington Post/ABC poll, down 17 points.

I called up a real pollster. I said, "What is that?" "Sir, that's called a suppression poll. I think you're going to win Wisconsin, sir."

I said, "But why don't they make it four or five points?" Because then people vote. But when you're down 17, they say, "Hey, I'm not going to waste my time. I love the president, but there's no way."

Despite that, despite that, we won Wisconsin. It's going to see. I mean, you'll see. But that's called suppression because a lot of people when they see that. It's very interesting. This pollster said, "Sir, if you're down three, four, or five people vote. When you go down 17, they say, 'Let's save. Let's go and have dinner and let's watch the presidential defeat tonight on television, darling.'"

And just like the radical left tries to blacklist you on social media. Every time I put out a tweet, that's, even if it's totally correct, totally correct, I get a flag. I get a flag.

And they also don't let you get out. You know, on Twitter, it's very hard to come onto my account. It's very hard to get out a message. They don't let the message get out nearly like they should. But I've had many people say, "I can't get on your Twitter." I don't care about Twitter. Twitter's bad news. They're all bad news.

But you know what, if you want to, if you want to get out a message and if you want to go through Big tech, social media, they are really, if you're a conservative, if you're a Republican, if you have a big voice, I guess they call it shadow banned, right? Shadow banned. They shadow ban you, and it should be illegal.

I've been telling these Republicans, get rid of Section 230. And for some reason, Mitch and the group, they don't want to put it in there and they don't realize that that's going to be the end of the Republican Party as we know it, but it's never going to be the end of us. Never. Let them get out. Let, let the weak ones get out. This is a time for strength.

They also want to indoctrinate your children in school by teaching them things that aren't so. They want to indoctrinate your children. It's all part of the comprehensive assault on our democracy, and the American people are finally standing up and saying no. This crowd is, again, a testament to it.

I did no advertising, I did nothing. You do have some groups that are big supporters. I want to thank that, Amy, and everybody. We have some incredible supporters, incredible. But we didn't do anything. This just happened. Two months ago, we had a massive crowd come down to Washington. I said, "What are they there for?" "Sir, they're there for you."

We have nothing to do with it. These groups are for, they're forming all over the United States. And we got to remember, in a year from now, you're going to start working on Congress and we got to get rid of the weak Congress, people, the ones that aren't any good, the Liz Cheneys of the world. We got to get rid of them. We got to get rid.

You know, she never wants a soldier brought home — I brought a lot of our soldiers home. I don't know, somewhat like it. They're in countries that nobody even knows the name, nobody knows where they are. They're dying. They're great, but they're dying. They're losing their arms, their legs, their face. I brought them back home, largely back home. Afghanistan, Iraq.

Remember, I used to say in the old days: "Don't go in Iraq. But if you go in, keep the oil." We didn't keep the oil. So stupid. So stupid these people. And Iraq has billions and billions of dollars now in the bank. And what did we do? We got nothing. We never get. But we do actually, we kept the oil here or we get, we did good.

We got rid of the ISIS caliphate. We got rid of plenty of different things that everybody knows and the rebuilding of our military in three years. People said it couldn't be done. And it was all made in the USA, all made in the USA, best equipment in the world.

In Wisconsin, corrupt Democrat-run cities deployed more than 500 illegal, unmanned, unsecured drop boxes, which collected a minimum of 91,000 unlawful votes. It was razor-thin, the loss. This one thing alone is much more than we would need. But there are many things.

They have these lockboxes. And, you know, they'd pick them up and they disappear for two days. People would say where's that box? They disappeared. Nobody even knew where the hell it was.

In addition, over 170,000 absentee votes were counted in Wisconsin without a valid absentee ballot application. So they had a vote, but they had no application, and that's illegal in Wisconsin. Meaning those votes were blatantly done in opposition to state law and they came 100% from Democrat areas such as Milwaukee and Madison, 100%.

In Madison, 17,000 votes were deposited in so-called human drop boxes. You know what that is, right? Where operatives stuff thousands of unsecured ballots into duffle bags on park benches across the city, in complete defiance of cease-and-desist letters from state legislature.

Your state legislatures said don't do it. They're the only ones that can approve it. They gave tens of thousands of votes. They came in in duffle bags. Where the hell did they come from?

According to eyewitness testimony, Postal Service workers in Wisconsin were also instructed to illegally backdate approximately 100,000 ballots. The margin of difference in Wisconsin was less than 20,000 votes. Each one of these things alone wins us the state. Great state. We love the state. We won the state.

In Georgia, your secretary of state who, I can't believe this guy's a Republican. He loves recording telephone conversations. You know, that was? I thought it was a great conversation personally. So did a lot of other. People love that conversation because it says what's going on.

These people are crooked. They're 100%, in my opinion, one of the most corrupt, between your governor and your secretary of state. And now you have it again last night. Just take a look at what happened. What a mess.

And the Democrat Party operatives entered into an illegal and unconstitution — unconstitutional settlement agreement that drastically weakened signature verification and other election security procedures.

Stacey Abrams. She took them to lunch. And I beat her two years ago with a bad candidate, Brian Kemp. But they took, the Democrats took the Republicans to lunch because the secretary of state had no clue what the hell was happening. Unless he did have a clue. That's interesting. Maybe he was with the other side.

But we've been trying to get verifications of signatures in Fulton County, they won't let us do it. The only reason they won't is because we'll find things in the hundreds of thousands. Why wouldn't they let us verify signatures in Fulton County, which is known for being very corrupt. They won't do it. They go to some other county where you would live.

I said, "That's not the problem." The problem is Fulton County, home of Stacey Abrams. She did a good job, I congratulate her. But it was done in such a way that we can't let this stuff happen. We won't have a country if it happens.

As a result, Georgia's absentee ballot rejection rate was more than 10 times lower than previous levels because the criteria was so off.

Forty-eight counties in Georgia, with thousands and thousands of votes, rejected zero ballots. There wasn't one ballot. In other words, in a year in which more mail-in ballots were sent than ever before, and more people were voting by mail for the first time, the rejection rate was drastically lower than it had ever been before.

The only way this can be explained is if tens of thousands of illegitimate votes were added to the tally. That's the only way you could explain it.

By the way, you're talking about tens of thousands. If Georgia had merely rejected the same number of unlawful ballots as in other years, they should have been approximately 45,000 ballots rejected. Far more than what we needed to win, just over 11,000. They should find those votes. They should absolutely find that. Just over 11,000 votes, that's all we need. They defrauded us out of a win in Georgia, and we're not going to forget it.

There's only one reason the Democrats could possibly want to eliminate signature matching, opposed voter ID, and stop citizenship confirmation. "Are you a citizenship?" You're not allowed to ask that question, because they want to steal the election.

The radical left knows exactly what they're doing. They're ruthless and it's time that somebody did something about it. And Mike Pence, I hope you're going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country. And if you're not, I'm going to be very disappointed in you. I will tell you right now. I'm not hearing good stories.

In Fulton County, Republican poll watchers were ejected, in some cases, physically from the room under the false pretense of a pipe burst. Water main burst, everybody leave. Which we now know was a total lie.

Then election officials pull boxes, Democrats, and suitcases of ballots out from under a table. You all saw it on television, totally fraudulent. And illegally scanned them for nearly two hours, totally unsupervised. Tens of thousands of votes. This act coincided with a mysterious vote dump of up to 100,000 votes for Joe Biden, almost none for Trump. Oh, that sounds fair. That was at 1:34 a.m.

The Georgia secretary of state and pathetic governor of Georgia, have reached, although he says I'm a great president. You know, I sort of maybe have to change. He said the other day, "Yes, I do. I disagree with president, but he's been a great president." Good, thanks. Thank you very much.

Because of him and others, you have Brian Kemp. Vote him the hell out of office, please. Well, his rates are so low. You know, his approval rating now, I think it just reached a record low.

They've rejected five separate appeals for an independent and comprehensive audit of signatures in Fulton County. Even without an audit, the number of fraudulent ballots that we've identified across the state is staggering.

Over 10,300 ballots in Georgia were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match Georgia residents who died in 2020 and prior to the election.

More than 2,500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match incarcerated felons in Georgia prison. People who are not allowed to vote.

More than 4,500 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the state's own voter rolls.

Over 18,000 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant, according to the Postal Service.

At least 88,000 ballots in Georgia were cast by people whose registrations were illegally backdated.

Sixty-six thousand votes, each one of these is far more than we need. Sixty-six thousand votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.

And at least 15,000 ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to November 3 election. They say they moved right back. They moved right back. Oh, they moved out, they moved right back. OK. They missed Georgia that much. I do. I love Georgia, but it's a corrupt system.

Despite all of this, the margin in Georgia is only 11,779 votes.

Each and every one of these issues is enough to give us a victory in Georgia, a big beautiful victory. Make no mistake, this election was stolen from you, from me and from the country.

And not a single swing state has conducted a comprehensive audit to remove the illegal ballots. This should absolutely occur in every single contested state before the election is certified.

In the state of Arizona, over 36,000 ballots were illegally cast by non-citizens. Two thousand ballots were returned with no address. More than 22,000 ballots were returned before they were ever supposedly mailed out. They returned, but we haven't mailed them yet.

Eleven thousand six hundred more ballots and votes were counted, more than there were actual voters. You see that? So you have more votes again than you have voters.

One hundred and fifty thousand people registered in Maricopa County after the registration deadline. One hundred and three thousand ballots in the county were sent for electronic adjudication with no Republican observers.

In Clark County, Nevada, the accuracy settings on signature verification machines were purposely lowered before they were used to count over 130,000 ballots.

If you signed your name as Santa Claus, it would go through.

There were also more than 42,000 double votes in Nevada. Over 150,000 people were hurt so badly by what took place. And 1,500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match Nevada residents who died in 2020 prior to November 3 election. More than 8,000 votes were cast by individuals who had no address and probably didn't live there.

The margin in Nevada is down at a very low number, any of these things would have taken care of the situation. We would have won Nevada, also. Every one of these we're going over, we win.

In Michigan, quickly, the secretary of state, a real great one, flooded the state with unsolicited mail-in ballot applications sent to every person on the rolls in direct violation of state law.

More than 17,000 Michigan ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match people who were deceased.

In Wayne County, that's a great one. That's Detroit. One hundred and seventy-four thousand ballots were counted without being tied to an actual registered voter. Nobody knows where they came from.

Also, in Wayne County, poll watchers observed canvassers rescanning batches of ballots over and over again, up to three or four or five times.

In Detroit, turnout was 139% of registered voters. Think of that. So you had 139% of the people in Detroit voting. This is in Michigan. Detroit, Michigan.

A career employee of the Detroit, City of Detroit, testified under penalty of perjury that she witnessed city workers coaching voters to vote straight Democrat while accompanying them to watch who they voted for. When a Republican came in, they wouldn't talk to him.

The same worker was instructed not to ask for any voter ID and not to attempt to validate any signatures if they were Democrats. She also told to illegally, and was told, backdate ballots received after the deadline and reports that thousands and thousands of ballots were improperly backdated. That's Michigan.

Four witnesses have testified under penalty of perjury that after officials in Detroit announced the last votes had been counted, tens of thousands of additional ballots arrived without required envelopes. Every single one was for a Democrat. I got no votes.

At 6:31 a.m. in the early morning hours after voting had ended, Michigan suddenly reported 147,000 votes. An astounding 94% went to Joe Biden, who campaigned brilliantly from his basement. Only a couple of percentage points went to Trump.

Such gigantic and one-sided vote dumps were only observed in a few swing states and they were observed in the states where it was necessary.

You know what's interesting? President Obama beat Biden in every state other than the swing states where Biden killed them, but the swing states were the ones that mattered.

They're always just enough to push Joe Biden barely into the lead. We were ahead by a lot and within a number of hours we were losing by a little.

In addition, there is the highly troubling matter of Dominion Voting Systems. In one Michigan county alone, 6,000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden and the same systems are used in the majority of states in our country.

Senator William Ligon, a great gentleman, chairman of Georgia's senate judiciary subcommittee. Senator Ligon, highly respected, on elections has written a letter describing his concerns with Dominion in Georgia.

He wrote, and I quote, The Dominion Voting Machines employed in Fulton County had an astronomical and astounding 93.67% error rate. It's only wrong 93% of the time in the scanning of ballots requiring a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voter's interest in over 106,000 ballots out of a total of 113,000.

Think of it. You go in and you vote and then they tell people who you supposed to be voting for. They make up whatever they want. Nobody's ever even heard.

They adjudicate your vote. They say, Well, we don't think Trump wants to vote for Trump. We think he wants to vote for Biden. Put it down for Biden.

The national average for such an error rate is far less than 1% and yet you're at 93%. The source of this astronomical error rate must be identified to determine if these machines were set up or destroyed to allow for a third party to disregard the actual ballot cast by the registered voter.

The letter continues. There is clear evidence that tens of thousands of votes were switched from President Trump to former Vice President Biden in several counties in Georgia.

For example, in Bibb County, President Trump was reported to have 29,391 votes at 9:11 p.m. Eastern time, while simultaneously Vice President Joe Biden was reported to have 17,213. Minutes later, just minutes, at the next update, these vote numbers switched with President Trump going way down to 17,000 and Biden going way up to 29,391. And that was very quick, a 12,000 vote switch all in Mr. Biden's favor.

So, I mean, I could go on and on about this fraud that took place in every state, and all of these legislatures want this back. I don't want to do it to you because I love you and it's freezing out here. But I could just go on forever. I can tell you this.

(Audience chants: "We love you.")

So when you hear, when you hear, while there is no evidence to prove any wrongdoing, this is the most fraudulent thing anybody has, this is a criminal enterprise. This is a criminal enterprise. And the press will say, and I'm sure they won't put any of that on there, because that's no good. And you ever see, while there is no evidence to back President Trump's assertion.

I could go on for another hour reading this stuff to you and telling you about it. There's never been anything like it.

Think about it. Detroit had more votes than it had voters. Pennsylvania had 205,000 more votes than it had more. But you don't have to go any. Between that, I think that's almost better than dead people if you think, right? More votes than they had voters. And many other states also.

It's a disgrace that the United States of America, tens of millions of people, are allowed to go vote without so much as even showing identification.

In no state is there any question or effort made to verify the identity, citizenship, residency or eligibility of the votes cast.

The Republicans have to get tougher. You're not going to have a Republican Party if you don't get tougher. They want to play so straight. They want to play so, sir, yes, the United States. The Constitution doesn't allow me to send them back to the States. Well, I say, yes it does, because the Constitution says you have to protect our country and you have to protect our Constitution, and you can't vote on fraud. And fraud breaks up everything, doesn't it? When you catch somebody in a fraud, you're allowed to go by very different rules.

So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do. And I hope he doesn't listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he's listening to.

It is also widely understood that the voter rolls are crammed full of non-citizens, felons and people who have moved out of state and individuals who are otherwise ineligible to vote. Yet Democrats oppose every effort to clean up their voter rolls. They don't want to clean them up. They're loaded.

And how many people here know other people, that when there are hundreds of thousands and then millions of ballots got sent out, got three, four, five, six, and I heard one, who got seven ballots. And then they say you didn't quite make it, sir.

We won in a landslide. This was a landslide. They said it's not American to challenge the election. This the most corrupt election in the history, maybe of the world.

You know, you could go third-world countries, but I don't think they had hundreds of thousands of votes and they don't have voters for them. I mean no matter where you go, nobody would think this.

In fact, it's so egregious, it's so bad that a lot of people don't even believe it. It's so crazy that people don't even believe it. It can't be true. So they don't believe it.

This is not just a matter of domestic politics — this is a matter of national security.

So today, in addition to challenging the certification of the election, I'm calling on Congress and the state legislatures to quickly pass sweeping election reforms, and you better do it before we have no country left.

Today is not the end, it's just the beginning.

With your help over the last four years, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country and nobody even challenges that.

I say that over and over, and I never get challenged by the fakeness, and they challenge almost everything we say.

But our fight against the big donors, big media, big tech, and others is just getting started. This is the greatest in history. There's never been a movement like that.

You look back there all the way to the Washington Monument. It's hard to believe.

We must stop the steal and then we must ensure that such outrageous election fraud never happens again, can never be allowed to happen again.

But we're going forward. We'll take care of going forward. We've got to take care of going back. Don't let them talk. OK, well, we promised. I've had a lot of people. Sir, you're at 96% for four years. I said I'm not interested right now. I'm interested in right there.

With your help, we will finally pass powerful requirements for voter ID. You need an ID to cash a check. You need an ID to go to a bank, to buy alcohol, to drive a car. Every person should need to show an ID in order to cast your most important thing, a vote.

We will also require proof of American citizenship in order to vote in American elections. We just had a good victory in court on that one, actually.

We will ban ballot harvesting and prohibit the use of unsecured drop boxes to commit rampant fraud. These drop boxes are fraudulent. Therefore, they get disapp — they disappear, and then all of a sudden they show up. It's fraudulent.

We will stop the practice of universal unsolicited mail-in balloting.

We will clean up the voter rolls that ensure that every single person who casts a vote is a citizen of our country, a resident of the state in which they vote and their vote is cast in a lawful and honest manner.

We will restore the vital civic tradition of in-person voting on Election Day so that voters can be fully informed when they make their choice.

We will finally hold big tech accountable. And if these people had courage and guts, they would get rid of Section 230, something that no other company, no other person in America, in the world has.

All of these tech monopolies are going to abuse their power and interfere in our elections, and it has to be stopped. And the Republicans have to get a lot tougher, and so should the Democrats. They should be regulated, investigated, and brought to justice under the fullest extent of the law. They're totally breaking the law.

Together, we will drain the Washington swamp and we will clean up the corruption in our nation's capital. We have done a big job on it, but you think it's easy. It's a dirty business. It's a dirty business. You have a lot of bad people out there.

Despite everything we've been through, looking out all over this country and seeing fantastic crowds. Although this, I think, is our all-time record. I think you have 250,000 people. 250,000.

Looking out at all the amazing patriots here today, I have never been more confident in our nation's future. Well, I have to say, we have to be a little bit careful. That's a nice statement, but we have to be a little careful with that statement.

If we allow this group of people to illegally take over our country because it's illegal when the votes are illegal when the way they got there is illegal when the states that vote are given false and fraudulent information.

We are the greatest country on Earth and we are headed and were headed in the right direction.

You know, the wall is built. We're doing record numbers at the wall. Now, they want to take down the wall. Let's let everyone flow in. Let's let everybody flow in. We did a great job in the wall. Remember, the wall, they said it could never be done. One of the largest infrastructure projects we've ever had in this country, and it's had a tremendous impact, that we got rid of catch and release. We got rid of all of this stuff that we had to live with.

But now, the caravans, I think Biden's getting in, the caravans are forming again. They want to come in again and rip off our country. Can't let it happen.

As this enormous crowd shows, we have truth and justice on our side. We have a deep and enduring love for America in our hearts. We love our country.

We have overwhelming pride in this great country and we have it deep in our souls. Together, we are determined to defend and preserve government of the people, by the people and for the people.

Our brightest days are before us. Our greatest achievements, still away.

I think one of our great achievements will be election security. Because nobody until I came along had any idea how corrupt our elections were.

And again, most people would stand there at 9 o'clock in the evening and say I want to thank you very much, and they go off to some other life. But I said something's wrong here, something is really wrong, can have happened.

And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.

Our exciting adventures and boldest endeavors have not yet begun. My fellow Americans, for our movement, for our children, and for our beloved country.

And I say this despite all that's happened. The best is yet to come.

So we're going to, we're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I love Pennsylvania Avenue. And we're going to the Capitol, and we're going to try and give.

The Democrats are hopeless — they never vote for anything. Not even one vote. But we're going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones because the strong ones don't need any of our help. We're going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.

So let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.

I want to thank you all. God bless you and God Bless America.

Thank you all for being here. This is incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you


Good morning, Mr. Bryce. 
I trust the pickup ran smoothly. Hand-off was clean. 
No stops till the exit point. 
Clear roads all the way, chief, just as you predicted. 
Thank you for agreeing 
to an earlier departure time, 
Mr. kurosawa. 
I'm honored that you and your wives have entrusted 
a triple-a protection service today. Moving red to green option, 
coming in on your vector. 
Get the engine started, 
I want an immediate takeoff. 
Air space has already been cleared. Roger that. 
All channels moving 
to restricted air space. 
Shall we? 
Mr. kurosawa... 
Another 
triple-a delivery, sir. 
Stay with him 
till he's airborne. 
- Yes, sir. 
- Canvas is clear? 
Nothing for miles, chief. Almost boring. And what's our motto? 
Boring is always best. 
Move! Move! 
Client down! Client down! 
Code seven! Code seven! 
Jesus! 
It's like a goddamn milkshake in here! Bravo one down. 
We need 
a clean-up team in here now! 
Repeat, bravo one down. 
Fucking piece of paper I've got here. l'm gonna beat this motherfucker's... Holy shit. 
Mr. seifert. 
Page 2/48
- Are we ready to go? 
- "Are we ready?" 
I've been waiting! 
What the hell took you so long? 
It's half past 9:00! 
Apologies. I had to make some 
preparations... Mr. seifert. 
Mr. seifert! 
It's best if I go through doors first. - Okay? 
- Okay. 
You don't know what I'm dealing with here. Come on, let's go, let's go. 
- Double time. 
- You don't understand. 
These people are animals! 
They're probably here already, 
- just waiting for me to leave. 
- I can appreciate your concern, but I assure you, you are perfectly safe. All you need to do 
is exactly what I tell you. 
Mr. seifert? Mr. seifert? 
This way, please. 
All right. Ls it not enough cocaine, or too much? 
They say you're triple-a rated. 
Is that a real thing? 
Let's just focus on you dying 
of natural causes, shall we? 
Soon. 
That's my car. 
Take a mental picture of it. 
I find it safer if we're using a car that blends in 
with the surrounding traffic. 
Well, that was easy. 
In fact, practically nothing at all. Boring is always best. 
I trust you'll reduce your... 
- what? 
- This is Michael Bryce. 
I'm an executive protection agent, fully licensed and bonded within the eu. 
Page 3/48
Fuckin' hell. I know it's you. 
I've got caller ID! 
Such a fucking dick. 
You got a pickup for me or what? Yes. I've extracted my client 
from 27 Saint George street. 
Clean-up is required. 
On the seventh floor, north stairwell, I've left a French national 
employed by the taray crime syndicate. You'll find two more 
in the south stairwell. 
On the roof, you're gonna find another who's gonna need some dental work. Ln the alley, there's two gentlemen who may require some counseling. One more in the east office 
on the sixth floor under construction and one on the number three elevator. Oh, oh, oh! 
Parking garage, 
under the Rolls-Royce in space five, there's a pound of plastic explosives, you might want to call the bomb squad. Check that. Make it the fire department. Is that my car? 
I'm afraid so. Have a seat, 
it's been a long day. 
That was a custom Rolls-Royce, 
one of a kind. 
I thought that was an unusual color. Was that periwinkle? 
I did find this in the backseat. Scraps! 
Precious, aren't they? 
It smells like ass in here. 
Buckle up. 
This car certainly 
isn't triple-a rated. 
It's not even fit for animals. 
Keep moving! 
Everybody go home! 
Get out of the way! 
Have a look there. 
Page 4/48
Knock on the doors. 
How's your English? 
I don't know much English, Mr. president. "The only way for the country to progress" is by eradicating the scourge of genocide "blackening our country 
and our livelihood." 
. L appreciate your modesty. 
I hope we're not... 
Disturbing your family. 
They are on holiday. 
Good for them. 
Family makes a man whole. 
I could have 
you executed for treason, 
but another would simply stand 
a little bit higher on your corpse. There must be some other lesson 
I could teach you. 
As I said, 
there is nothing more important... Than a good education. 
Professor Asimov, 
can you please tell the court 
what happened next? 
Then... I was taken 
to one of dukhovich's internment camps. I was there for three years 
until he was finally overthrown. Arrested like the monster he is. Thank you, professor Asimov. 
Your honor, I request 
that this entire testimony be disregarded. Without any evidence, 
this is merely hearsay. 
Sustained. 
The trial 
of former Belarusian president 
Vladislav dukhovich continued today with emotional testimony 
from many of his country's victims. But while powerful to hear, 
dukhovich's attorneys say 
they are nothing more 
Page 5/48
than the lies of his enemies. 
Long one of the world's 
most brutal dictators... 
Who stands accused 
of ethnic cleansing on a massive scale. An unprecedented level of security is in place around the courthouse. Even the airspace 
above this city is closed. 
So far, the prosecution 
has been crippled by the lack 
of any hard evidence 
against dukhovich himself. 
'Numerous witnesses 
who were expected 
to testify have disappeared. 
Ls there anyone brave enough 
to come forward with evidence 
and finally put an end 
to his brutal reign? 
Mr. Kincaid, 
this is lnterpol's offer. 
In return for your testimony 
against former president dukhovich, your wife will receive a full 
pardon from all jurisdictions. 
You're going to pardon an innocent woman? That's mighty fucking white of you. Assuming we accept this arrangement for Sonia Kincaid, 
there's still the matter 
of an agreement regarding my client. He will receive 
this letter recommending leniency. Mr. Kincaid is a contract killer facing two dozen counts 
of murder in ten countries. 
Absent a legitimate deal, 
he will never breathe free air again. Under no... 
Sonia goes free. 
We're all set, director casoria. Let's get this gentleman to the hague. Mr. Kincaid, 
Page 6/48

this is agent roussel. 
She'll be leading a security detail, which will escort you 
to the international criminal court. You know, dukhovich's men have killed every single witness brought against them, and my security detail 
is a dozen off-duty cops? 
These are the most highly-trained officers in Europe, Mr. Kincaid. 
We have taken every precaution 
to make sure that your involvement is completely classified. 
It's a secret? 
That makes me feel so much better. Well, I can assure you, 
even if there was an attempt, 
we're more than prepared for any assault. You prepared for that assault, 
motherfucker? 
Uncuff me, give me some car keys, a couple guns, I'll meet you guys there. Uncuff me, give me some car keys, a couple guns, I'll meet you guys there. Uncuff me, give me some car keys, a couple guns, I'll meet you guys there. The court's deadline 
is at 5: 
That gives us 27 hours to transport you from Manchester to the Netherlands. If you want to help your wife, 
you should get moving. 
Okay, inspector clouseau, 
let's see what these elite troops of yours can do. 
Come on, guys, let's go. 
Agent roussel, 
I don't have to remind 
you of the importance of this. 
- No, ma'am. 
- And don't doubt what he's capable of. I won't, sir. 
- Take a left on kirkland Avenue. Page 7/48

- Yes. 
What a pretty little town. 
Old, narrow streets, 
buildings nice and close, 
lots of great views 
from all those windows. 
This route's been wiped clean for us. Nothing to worry about. 
Ls that right? 
How's that nose of yours doing? Take a diversion route. 
Got a boyfriend, roussie? 
Significant other? 
I need you to be quiet, Mr. Kincaid. I'm just saying, 
now might be the perfect time 
to write one of those 
"I'll always love you" texts. 
Relax, motherfucker. 
If you hear the shot, 
it wasn't meant for you. 
Two-two-one, 
ten-four en route. 
Fuck! 
Cover me! 
Move! Move! 
Cover me! 
Move! Move! 
Go! Get that door open! 
Go! Go! Alpha squad, with me! 
Agent Roberts, protect the witness! Parker, take the left flank! 
Shit! We need more backup! 
Follow me! 
Fuck! 
Agent roussel! 
God damn it, somebody! 
We need backup n... 
turn around! 
It's ready! 
Come on! 
Lay down some cover fire. 
Fuck! 
- Show me your hands! 
Page 8/48
- Bitch, please! 
- Put these on. 
- Fuck that. 
Interpol's compromised. You know that. Either you shoot me or watch me bleed out. We gotta get off the street. 
There's a safe house 
not far from here. 
As a car bomb has 
exploded in bishopgate green, 
near coventry city center... 
Don't even think 
about answering that fucking phone! The only way dukhovich 
could've known our route 
was if he had somebody on the inside. Now, I need medical supplies, 
and you need help. 
So, if you're gonna call somebody, they have to be totally out of the loop. I've had 
the black diamond service 
four times now, you understand? 
Four times. The car still 
smells like a cemetery. 
Are you washing the car with old assholes? Or... 
Just help me to understand. 
Just a second here. 
Hello, Amelia. 
I'm texting you an address in coventry. You need to get there immediately. Bring three units of o-negative blood. I'm doing very well, thank you. 
How are you? 
I don't have 
the time for this, Michael. 
I have a job I need you to do. 
- Pass. 
- I wasn't offering. I'm telling you. I have a job you're going to do. I'm not gonna let you charm me 
into this one, Amelia. 
Okay, let's be clear. 
Page 9/48

I'm not any happier about this 
than you are, 
but I don't have a choice. 
Well, thank god I do. 
No, Michael, you don't. 
Because if you're not 
where I need you to be, 
I'm going to expose 
you and your work to interpol. 
That elite triple-a status 
you want back so badly, 
- I'll make sure you never get near it. - You're threatening me now? 
Not you, her. Are you threatening... you can't just threaten me 
into taking orders from you. 
I guess we'll see. You're three hours away. I'll see you in two and a half. Three... okay, okay. 
I guess we will. Jesus Christ. 
Here, we're gonna load 
all these into the car, okay? 
We're gonna take the car out in the front, and then burn it. 
This place is like a war zone. 
We got bodies everywhere. 
Our unit's compromised. Everyone's down. Get those guys lded. 
And I've got no sign of agent roussel. Maybe 15 to 20 
dead mercenaries, heavily armed. Media circus is in town. 
That's not the worst of it. 
Kincaid is gone. 
Coventry, every available agent. Report back to me with any updates. Yes, ma'am. 
There must've been a leak. 
I told you, there are too many 
agencies involved. 
Get to the hague. 
See what you can get out of dukhovich. L'll try. 
And alert the penitentiary in Amsterdam. Page 10/48

Have them triple the guard 
around Kincaid's wife. 
Got it. 
Mrs. Kincaid, your attorney. 
Did I tell you you could turn around? What do you want, 
you useless piece of shit? 
Baby, baby, it's me. 
My baql 
what do you want, 
you fucking hijo de puta motherfucker! I just wanted to hear your voice. Fuck you! 
There, you heard my voice. 
The only reason I'm in this shit hole is so that they can get to your sorry ass! How you doing? Made a shank yet? What for? 
It's prison, baby. 
You got to protect yourself. 
It's a Dutch prison, Darius! 
What are they gonna do, 
beat me with a clog? 
You got a view at least? 
Just a whole lot of corny Dutch buildings. There's one 
with a huge fucking clock on it. Like that's what I need right now. Do they have those flowers you love? Lrises? 
They come from there, right? 
Fucking tulips, Darius. 
What kind of a piece-of-shit husband doesn't remember 
his wife's favorite flowers? 
You never remember anything. 
What's our anniversary? 
I'm gonna make this up to you, baby. You see, that's what 
I'm talking about, cabrn. 
Darius, is something wrong? 
Not a thing, baby. Not a fucking thing. Then I want to hear it. 
- Hello? Sonia? 
Page 11/48
- Hello? Darius! 
You fucking piece of shit! 
You fucking shit! 
Go ahead, 
you might as well finish the job. Why am I here, Amelia? 
A high-value transport. 
Oh, high value? Oh, I don't... 
I don't really do high value anymore. These days I'm more in the... 
Mid-level coked-out attorney market. Why do you think that is? 
Seriously, Michael? 
Because of you. 
You used me to climb the interpol ladder, and here we are again. 
You up for a promotion? 
You have to blame me for every little bump in your road, don't you. 
No, these aren't bumps. No, no, no bumps. Just one dead Japanese arms dealer. - I had nothing to do... 
- "...To do with." 
Do you know what happens 
when a triple-a rated 
executive protection agent 
loses a client? 
Triple-a. I was up here, yeah? 
Then I opened up to you. Why wouldn't I? I was in love with you. 
And I fucking told you his name. It was the first time in my entire career I revealed a client's name. 
I trusted you. 
Now I'm down here. The dead guy's up here. I'm sorry, Michael, 
you hit a rough patch. 
"A rough..." 
A 300-pound investment banker's ass exploded four bags of heroin 
in the backseat of my car last week. Those aren't leather seats, 
those are cloth. 
- Okay, Michael... 
Page 12/48
- Want you to take a minute 
to think of what that clean-up might be. I don't have the time 
for your insane shit, okay? 
At that point, you sell the car. - I never used you! 
- The depreciation... 
I just left you! 
Because you couldn't forgive me for something I didn't even do. Transport is in there. 
Is that blood, dude... 
what the fuck? 
You know how long 
I've been waiting for this? 
Oh, no, no. I'm not gonna look. Motherfucker! 
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's talk about this, okay? 
Even a dumbass like you is smart enough to keep one in the... pipe. 
Oh, shit. 
And nighty night. 
- Darius Kincaid. Jesus Christ. - Michael. 
This is who you want me to protect? My shirt! 
Fine, fine. 
You get the feet, I'll get the nostrils. The trial 
of former Belarusian president 
Vladislav dukhovich 
took an uncertain turn this week, having recently survived 
a dioxin poisoning attempt 
that left his face disfigured. 
- Authorities are keeping dukhovich... - Interpol wishes to have a word. Quite the dust-up in coventry 
this morning. 
But you wouldn't know anything 
about that, would you? 
You've come here to lodge a complaint? I've come for my money. 
Page 13/48

I delivered as promised. 
I gave you Kincaid as exposed 
as you'll ever get him. 
Small security detail, 
practically a rookie leading them. I can't do more than that. 
Let's be fair here. 
You think it's fair 
that you want something for nothing? In my country... 
we would skin you like a cat. 
Would that be fair? 
I come from nothing. I work all my life... Serving the people. 
And then they come into my country and they took it all away! 
And now they lock me up like a rat, feed me poison! 
Is this fair? 
When Kincaid is dead, 
you'll be paid in full. 
You know he's a murderer, right? You're playing nurse to a murderer. - A witness. Mmm-hmm. 
- Really? 
Twenty-seven times. 
That's how many times this asshole has tried to kill me, 27... 28! 
Fucking Prague! 
If dukhovich is acquitted, 
he'll be back in power next week. I won't let that happen. 
Good. 
You should take him to the hague. I can't! 
There's a mole inside interpol. 
- It's already cost me 12 good officers. - Good? 
That's subjective. 
Nice. Maybe they were nice. 
I'll make it simple for you; 
If I stay near him, they'll find him. So I gotta risk my life 
protecting this coffin magnet over here? Page 14/48

So I gotta risk my life 
protecting this coffin magnet over here? So I gotta risk my life 
protecting this coffin magnet over here? No, no, no. You gotta put something - in the pot. 
- How about your career? 
- How about it? 
- Your precious career. 
You do this job for me, 
and I'll get you back to elite status. Yeah, you don't have that power. I've got connections. 
You want back in? I can put you there. Why would I trust you? 
Why? 
Because I've never lied to you, Michael. You're terrible at almost everything, but you're good at keeping people alive. Keep him alive... please, 
and you get your dream life back. And as bonus, 
you'll never hear from me again. Good. 
Still. 
Where are you? 
Setting up operation 
at coventry police headquarters. You got nothing from dukhovich? Are you surprised? 
- Ma'am? 
- Busy. 
I've picked up activity 
at our safe house in town. 
Is this something 
I need to know right now? 
No, not normally. 
But, yes, it should be vacant. 
And you believe it's not? 
Well, the access code 
was activated 
without identity authorization. Could Kincaid have gotten inside? But it's on a revolving encryption. 
Page 15/48
Get a team over there. Now! 
And where is agent roussel? 
Sorry, got to go. 
Good luck. 
I believe I know where Kincaid is. What the fuck is all this? 
You're a fugitive. 
Fugitives wear restraints. 
No, no, no, not the cuffs. 
I'm talking about these whack-ass, hipster clothes I'm wearing. 
Yeah, luckily I brought extra. 
Lucky for who? 
Shit. Am I wearing underwear? 
Those are for me too, 
in case I have to change your pants again. Not a fan. 
You know they call them 
swinging dicks for a reason. 
How about we never speak of this again? Shit. Interpol protocol. 
When that phone rings and nobody answers, they're gonna send officers to the door. And there they are. 
Yes, we're setting our perimeter. Comfy? 
So, what happened 
to little miss interpol? 
Agent roussel's gone. 
Damn! I liked her. She's spunky. This building has two stairwells, - no fire escapes... 
- No fire escapes 
and no adjacent rooftops. 
You know, you're not the only 
observant motherfucker on the planet. I go through doors first. 
I check to see if it's clear, 
then you follow. 
Really? You think that's necessary? - My job is to keep you out of harm's way. - Shit, motherfucker. 
I am harm's way. 
Two hostiles, maybe more. 
Page 16/48
I don't suppose I could have a gun? No. We're gonna take 
the north stairwell. Let's go. 
Fuck! 
- It's him! 
- Come on! 
Thank god you're here. 
I don't know 
what I would've done without you. Well done. Guess what happens now? Shots fired! Shots fired! 
All units sending in nine-nine. 
Now we have a new problem. 
I like to keep things 
a little more subtle. 
See? Boring is better. 
Okay. That's very loud. 
It was empty anyway 
we're identifying 
heat signatures on the rooftop 
moving in a northbound direction. Copy that! Go, go, go! 
They're on the roof! 
No, no, no. No odds in thatjump. It beats the hell out of whatever's gonna come through that door. 
No. Just gotta... 
We just gotta find 
a more intelligent way... 
Motherfucker! Ahh! Shit! 
Holy fucking shit. 
Secure the roof! Go, go, go! 
Delta squad with me! 
- They're on the north side! 
- Copy that! 
Made that jump on one leg. 
I made that jump 
without jumping. Let's go. 
So, what's your next trick, 
showing me how we escape without escaping? Let's just try to get to the car without killing anyone, all right? - Ls this your car? 
- One of them. 
Page 17/48
I remember 
shooting at you in a Jaguar. 
Buckle up. If we get 
in a high-speed chase, 
I want you strapped in. 
I'm more worried 
about the wheels coming off this bitch when you reach the speed limit. Back in the day, 
we wouldn't have even stolen 
this piece of shit, 
and we stole everything. 
I remember one night... 
I know all I need to know about you. All your early arrests, 
your father in and out of prison, you following in the same footsteps. Did your little research, did you? Prepare for a test, 
there are no surprises. 
And you grew up wanting to be a cop till you found out 
wasn't no money in that shit. 
So you joined the CIA, 
sharpened your skills, 
so you joined the CIA, 
sharpened your skills, 
so you joined the CIA, 
sharpened your skills, 
then decided to open your own shop, pimp yourself out to the fat cats. I didn't even have to do 
no research to know that shit. It's written all over your punk-ass. Can't wait to hear what I'll do next. That's great. 
You know, why don't... 
Why don't you lay back 
and keep from getting spotted. Get comfortable. 
That's a good idea. 
Smells like ass back here! 
Bet that jag never smelled like ass. These your electrolytes? 
Page 18/48

Facial recognition 
identifies this man 
as Michael Bryce. 
But you already know that, 
don't you, agent roussel? 
You two have a history. 
Long time ago. 
You slipped Kincaid 
into our own safe house, 
then brought in this... 
Executive protection agent? 
Official channels had been compromised. What did you expect me to do? 
Clearly, our office security's been breached. 
The red notice stays. 
You, however, can go. 
I'm placing you on leave. 
You will surrender 
your weapon and credentials. 
You are going to be telling 
this story for years, Amelia, 
from inside a very large office or a very small cell. 
Well, I like my odds. 
The only way Bryce and Kincaid don't make it to the hague 
is if they kill each other first. Amelia. 
She's making a mistake. 
We need to plug our leak. 
Now, this Bryce, do you trust him? With something like this, yes. I'll speak to casoria, 
get her to allow you to come 
to the hague with us. 
But no more secrets. 
Thank you, sir. 
Search for car, plate fj56mhv. They'll have identified the car with the traffic cams by now. 
And you. Welcome to fugitive life. Until I turn you in. 
Just need to find a different vehicle, Page 19/48

older model, no alarm. Right here. Luckily, I came prepared. 
You know, if you're gonna be a while, I can just go in there and get a room. There's an art to low-impact, 
high-efficiency 
breaking and entering, but... 
Art's subjective. 
And you're bleeding again. 
You know, for a dude 
that runs around killing people, you've got this really strange 
thing about bleeding. 
It's inefficient. 
And I don't kill people, I protect them. Hector Ramirez. 
Hector Ramirez was an assassin. 
Yeah, I know. I trained him. 
Who was holding a knife 
to my client's throat. 
And you killed him. 
No. I saved my client. 
I think Hector might have 
a different perspective on that. Oh, is that so? Well, here's the thing. I was a triple-a rated 
executive protection agent. 
- You just made up that triple-a shit. - No, I did not! 
And if guys like you... 
if sociopaths like you 
weren't running around trying to kill my clients, then no one would get hurt. Triple-a, yeah. It sounds like you ought to be selling life insurance 
or fixing my fucking transmission, or something. 
Well, 
you're uninsurable, trust me. 
And you said "was." 
- "I was a triple-a, x-rated dickhead!" - No, I said "am." Get in the fucking car! Get in the fucking car! 
Jesus fucking Christ. 
Page 20/48

You definitely said "was." 
"Was" as in, 
"I used to be a triple-x 
dickhead driving a jag, 
but now I'm rolling around 
in this shit-wagon." 
Put your seatbelt on. 
What happened? Lose your edge? Drop focus? You slip up 
and let a client get popped? 
Never slipped up. 
Well, how did "am" become "was"? I don't actually know. I mean, how does a so-called expert assassin get busted by interpol? 
Love, baby. Straight-up love. 
See, I'm doing 
this job in Geneva, right? 
Some dude washing the 
wrong dude 's money. 
I get a call. 
What? 
My wife's been in a car accident, - bad one. 
- W hat? 
So, Geneva dude gets a pass, 
I jet back to Mexico City, 
go straight to the hospital. 
Bopped up in Sonia's room, 
two dozen agents waiting for me. Played by the heart. 
Happens to the best of us, man. I mean, sort of like how 
agent roussel took you from here to here... to here. 
Assassin and eavesdropper. 
You're a real double threat. 
Well, you were whining like a bitch so loud, I heard you through the wall. Agent roussel and I 
aren't any of your concern. 
So, she dumped you because 
of all your tight-assed, 
"boring is good, look before you leap, Page 21/48

"put your seatbelt on" shit? 
She didn't dump me. 
Oh, motherfucker, I know she dumped you. I'm just perusing all the reasons why, and there's a plethora 
of those motherfuckers. 
- Plethora? 
- Yeah. It means a lot. 
I know what plethora means! 
It just doesn't apply here! 
And not jumping off the top of a roof, that's logical, that's safe. 
You know, wearing a seatbelt: 
Logical, safe. 
Let me ask you something, 
how many times have you been shot? - Counting today? 
- Yeah. 
- Too many to count. You? 
- Yeah, I bet. 
Zero. 
Now, we both know that's bullshit. That's not bullshit, okay? 
This was a little flesh wound. 
You just kind of zinged it right there. Didn't even require a band-aid. You got lucky. 
Yeah, the rock shifted 
just as I took the shot. 
- You lucky motherfucker. 
- Fuck! 
Fuck! 
Fucking Prague. 
Yeah, Prague. 
You never even took one for a client? Nope. Never had to. 
Yeah, but the question is, would you? See, if I'm paying triple-a rates, then I'm looking 
for that full-service shit, 
you know what I'm saying? 
That extra "a" stands for "ass," yours, between mine and a bullet. Being prepared for everything 
Page 22/48
means that that situation statistically just won't occur. 
Bryce, you cannot be 
prepared for everything! 
Life is gonna bloody us up, okay? You just gotta put a band-aid 
on that shit and keep rolling! 
That's really beautiful, man. 
Do you ever just write stuff down? I don't know, throw down a haiku or two? - $ I saw the sign I 
-. nobody x 
- $ it opened up my eyes I saw the sign a' -. nobody, nobody, nobody r 
- $ life is demanding I 
-. nobody gets out alive a' 
how'd you like that, motherfucker? Do you have any idea how stupid you sound? I mean, what a fuck-up! 
You lost my husband, and you're like, "can you please help us find him?" Why the fuck should I? 
That is your fucking job, motherfucker! But, obviously, you suck at it. 
You received 
a phone call today from your attorney. Sq? 
Well, we asked your attorney, 
but... he said he didn't have 
any contact with you. 
What? Are you fucking kidding me? Okay, that's it! 
I've had it with this lawyer! 
He's an alcoholic. 
He calls me completely drunk, 
and he starts saying 
the most inappropriate things. 
Like, for example, 
what he likes to do to his wife's ass. That is a disgusting place 
to hide a child's toy! 
And you know what? 
I don't need to listen to this shit! Then he forgets about it, 
Page 23/48
but I'm stuck with the images in my head! Mrs. Kincaid, 
if you know where your husband is, you need to tell us. 
It's for his own safety. 
I'm sorr... you're worried 
about my husband's safety? 
No one in this world 
can kill Darius Kincaid. 
The man is a cucaracha, 
and I mean that 
in every sense of the word. 
Sometimes you just want to crush his little, filthy head with your shoe, but he won't die. 
That motherfucker is unkillable, so you can relax. 
But wait, no. 
There is one important thing 
that you should know. 
Motherfuckers, get out of my fucking cell. Great. 
Now! 
And I want that lawyer fired! 
I want that lawyer fired! 
I want a good one, professional lawyer! I have rights! Human rights! 
Okay, you can take a five-minute break. Good evening. 
Can I help you? 
We need to see your cameras. 
Sorry, sir, that's for management only. L 90'! You! 
Where we at? 
I backtracked west. 
West is the wrong direction. 
Thank you. Thank you. 
They'd be expecting us 
to take a direct route. 
The fuck is that you're eating? 
Postpones fatigue. 
Refuels glycogen and electrolytes. I got you one, too, 
while you were taking 
Page 24/48
one of your world-class naps. 
I'd stay awake if you let me drive. Thank you. That's really generous of... no! I gotta piss. 
Use that. 
Timeline's not built for another break. Your dick might fit 
in here, but mine... 
Plus, I need every drop of this shit to tolerate this ride with you. 
Just pull the fucking car over. 
Jesus Christ. 
It'd be a lot easier without these cuffs, or this fucking underwear. 
Kincaid! 
Hey, asshole! 
Ugh! Fucking god damn it, that's not mud! You think I'm a fucking idiot? 
Well... 
You did think that cheap whiskey was piss. Fuck! 
Where the hell did that come from? This is what happens 
when you mess with a perfectly laid plan. - Give me a gun. Give me a goddamn gun! - I got this! I got this! 
There's more than one. 
A- ha! Perfect deduction, Sherlock. Draw their fire so I can take a look. All right. Go! 
Ow! 
- Shit! 
- Okay. 
Three shooters in a row, all lit up. So, what do you want to do? 
While you can't come up with a plan, they're gonna kill us. 
So here's the plan. 
- What the fuck? 
- You take eleven o'clock, I'll take one. Let's see who gets to twelve first. Okay. On three. You ready? 
One... 
I said on three. You shot early. 
Page 25/48
Yeah, before they did. 
Let me break it down... 
so much for your intricately 
calculated travel plans. 
That's why I was trying 
to bounce on your ass. 
See, I'm safer on my own. 
There's no way that they could've known - where we were. 
- Well, they did, and now they're dead. This yours? Ls this your cell phone? I might've taken that off some dead merc. You might've... 
You know, they can track a cell phone. That's why I use a ghost chip in mine, so they can't track the phone. 
I mean, that's how they know 
where we were! 
Here I am, I'm plotting courses all over the country, 
and you're carrying a location beacon in your pocket! 
My bad. 
Your bad? 
You don't even understand how 
21st century technology works! I mean, how have you stayed alive this long? While all you guys are wasting your time planning and aiming and deducing, I just do my thing, 
and my thing has always been better than your fucking thing. 
Great. There you go. 
That's just great. 
I'm glad that your thing has 
always been better than mine. 
You're not gonna take this gun? No, you keep that gun. 
Use it to shoot me. 
No, no, no, I was gonna 
shoot you with this... 
shit! 
There go the guns. 
Well, look on the bright side. 
Page 26/48
We get the bad guys' Van. 
This field smells like your car. Dude, I said I was sorry about the phone. Who knows, maybe 
your plan would've worked. 
- So, what about your other plan? - There's no plan! 
The plan is we're in a cow pasture, that's the plan. 
I'm talking about your agent roussel plan. That's why you're doing this, right? Get her back? 
You think becoming 
a triple-a card-carrying dickhead is gonna give you an all-access 
backstage pass to agent roussel's ass, - and she'll fall in love. 
- I get it. 
- You're gonna be the guy... 
- And your life will have meaning again. that the other inmates come to 
for advice. They're very lucky. 
Motherfucker, please. 
I've eaten hamburgers 
that know more about women than you. - You, my friend, are a romantic retard. - Hey! 
Just 'cause I want to get my business back in order, that doesn't make me a shitty person. 
And Amelia has nothing, 
absolutely nothing, to do with this. Oh man. You are so in love, it is crazy. Christ, do you ever shut up? 
Why is everything always 
about love with you? 
Well, what else is there? 
I mean, take away the guns, the money, the travel, the perfect shot 
through a motherfucker's 
earhole from 300 meters. 
I mean, none of that shit means dick if I can't tell Sonia about it. 
Well, I guess Amelia's 
Page 27/48
just not as special as Sonia. 
She sounds great. 
- What, she cheat on you? 
- No. 
- Try to kill you? 
- No. 
'Cause Sonia chopped off part of my ear with a machete one time. 
She sewed it back on, but... 
It was two, three days before 
our shit got real again. 
Where'd you guys meet, christianmingle? No. A bar in Honduras. 
One of those places 
where nobody knows your face and name. I'd just come off a job. 
Some dude kidnapped 
the wrong dude's daughter. 
I was sitting there chilling, 
when I noticed this waitress 
getting hassled by these guys. 
I got up to help her, when she unleashed the most amazing display 
of violence and beauty 
I had ever seen. 
When she severed that dude's 
carotid artery with a beer bottle, I knew. 
I knew right then. 
We slow danced all night. 
She sounds like she's gonna 
make a good mother someday. 
Lights. 
Need a ride? 
Yeah. We're trying to catch 
a ferry to Amsterdam. 
- Yeah, I can get you there. 
- Yeah? 
Jump in. 
Hey, hey, hey, there's eyes 
all over Amsterdam for me. 
That's where Sonia's locked up. It's a quick in and out. 
I got a place there. 
Page 28/48

- You got a place in Amsterdam? - Yeah. 
Is that where you keep the jag? You know what? 
Why don't you go fuck yourself 
and the horse you... hello. 
Hello, beautiful sisters. 
Whose lap will I sit on'? 
One more! 
Your stop, boys! 
You take care, sisters. 
Bye, Kincaid! 
Go with god! 
This man's killed over 150 people. Two-fifty, easy. 
Yeah, but they love you. 
Me, they want to perform an exorcism on. Question for a higher power. 
Who is more wicked, 
he who kills evil motherfuckers or he who protects them? 
You really believe you're the good guy? My first contract... I was... 
I don't know, 16, 17. 
There was a guy who broke into a church. The preacher was still there, 
so he told the guy, 
"look, you don't have to steal anything. Take whatever you want." 
Dude wasn't there for the loot. He wanted to hurt somebody. 
Slaughters the preacher, 
displays his body on the altar 
for his congregation to see. 
The Bible says never to take revenge, to leave it to the lord. 
But I wasn't prepared to wait that long. So, when your moral compass 
gets around to pointing at me, 
yeah, you'll be pointing 
at one of the good guys. 
And how does one 
of the good guys get connected 
with a piece of shit like dukhovich? Page 29/48

I didn't know everything 
the dude was into. 
That's an easy excuse. 
Look, you know everything 
about every client you ever had? Nope. I don't decide 
whether my clients live or die. [Michael son of a bitch. 
Coitig oh, come on, come oh, come on. When's the last time you paid rent on this safe house? 
I haven't done a lot 
of Amsterdam jobs lately. 
I just need to get my gear. 
The problem is that... 
All the windows are polycarb. 
They have... extra layers of laminate, and obviously there's 
a hetzger alarm system, 
which is the premiere unit on the market. It's got three fail-safes. 
But if I can just... 
What the... 
- Jesus Christ! 
- Nope. Darius Kincaid. 
But there are no words. I am amazing. That's so cute! 
You look so happy here. 
So, is agent roussel 
the only photograph-worthy 
girl in your life? 
Been busy working. 
Whoa! 
You must give me your designer's number. We got four hours to court, 
let's get cleaned up. 
I need to change my bandage 
and take a shower. 
The hot water still work in this bitch? Upstairs. 
- Elevator? 
- No! 
Fuck! 
Counsel, approach the bench. 
Page 30/48
How can you allow Kincaid's testimony? A hired killer given a sweetheart deal. A man like that will say 
anything to save himself. 
Kincaid has no sweetheart deal. 
His wife will go free, not him. 
The testimony will be allowed, 
assuming you produce 
your witness by 5:00 P. M. 
- Michael, you should've been here by now. - Yeah. Just a couple of bumps. 
We're on our way. 
The judge isn't giving us any wiggle room. You have less than four hours now! Well, we're gonna be there in half that. Then why are you calling me? 
Right. Well... 
I'm calling you because 
I've been thinking, and... 
I forgive you. 
Yeah. 
It feels good to say that. 
I forgive you, Amelia. 
Are you fucking kidding me'? 
What? 
You're seriously doing this now? - No. What? 
- And forgive me for what? 
- There's nothing to forgive! 
- No, no, no, look, I thought that you... - Just get Kincaid here! 
- Fucking prick! 
Darius? 
Fuck! 
Yeah. We've got the whole area covered. If Kincaid shows up, he's ours. 
Stay alert. 
Copy that. 
Yeah, tulips. 
That will be 25. 
Easy 
ay, mi cucaracha. 
Couldn't you just had 
the flowers delivered? 
Page 31/48
Needed a personal touch. 
You were about to get 
his personal touch, 
if I hadn't followed you. 
All right, I appreciate you. 
And the guys who started 
tracking you a few blocks ago. 
You mean the guy you snatched in the bush, and the two you left 
knocked out in the park? 
Like I said, I appreciate you. 
Okay, so if you knew 
that they were out there, 
but you still felt it was important to deliver these flowers? 
Sonia's gonna really love those flowers. I sure fucking hope so. 
Now, this is as close 
as I'm gonna be to her 
for a very long time. 
It had to be special. 
First. 
I'm first. Look... you were saying? Tell me something. 
The day you and agent roussel 
took that picture I saw in your place, what kind of things would you have done for her to make her happy? 
Anything. I loved her. Trusted her. She sold me out. Case closed. 
Well, that's cold. Maybe, just maybe, you ought to give her a pass on this. I mean, I gotta tell you, honestly, there's not a lot of women 
who'd put up with your shit. 
That's inspirational, thank you. What I meant to say: 
There's no women who would put up with it. - That's better. 
- You're an annoying motherfucker with all your rules and shit. 
I mean, if she can put up with that, she must be a pretty special girl. She is. 
Page 32/48
You know, I told her today 
that I forgave her. 
Really? And how'd that go? 
Hard to tell. 
You know, women don't like 
to be forgiven for shit 
'cause that implies they did 
some shit to begin with. 
I should just forget about kurosawa. - W hat? 
- Takashi kurosawa. 
He was my client, she exposed him, and he got killed. 
Something funny? 
She didn't expose your client! 
I popped kurosawa! 
I was at the airport for another target. I spotted him by accident. 
Lucky for me. Him, not so much. Doubled my money 
on that corrupt Asian motherfucker. The single most awesome shot 
I've made in my entire hitman career. Three hundred meters through a firm, c- cup tittie-sized window. 
Hey, I thought you knew 
I was the one who popped him. 
'Zzz 
- shit! What the fuck, Bryce! Mother... - we're done! 
That shit was two years ago, man. You gonna be a little bitch about it? You're on your own! 
Well, good! I'll be safer on my own! You won't last one hour without me! You'll be dead in a minute! 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're about as useful as a condom in a convent. 
- Eat my ass! 
- That's what she said! 
- Suck it! Suck it! 
- Fuck you! 
Fucking pussy 
fuck! 
Page 33/48
Do you have any idea how prepared I was? No, not really. 
No. Every possible scenario 
I had covered, every kill shot, 
every... every angle. 
And he fucking ruins my life 
with one lucky shot 
through a window the size of a... Just a... 
There he goes again. 
Shots fired! Shots fired! 
I hope they kill him. I really do. Okay. 
Even if I did save him, again, 
you know what he'd say? 
He'd say, "I had it all 
figured out before you got here." He'd say, "I guess my thing" 
just better than your thing, 
motherfucker." 
"I guess bullets are just allergic to me, motherfucker." 
This guy singlehandedly ruined 
the word "motherfucker." 
Do you know how hard that is to do? I was triple-a rated executive protection. I was up here. 
I was up here. 
And god damn it! 
Pass me the magazine. 
There he is! 
Hi. 
Requesting all units, heading south! Shoot him! 
Under the bridge! On your right! Sorry. 
Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! God damn it! 
Who are these guys? 
Go, go, go, go, go! 
Turn! 
He's getting away! 
Watch out! 
To the right! 
Page 34/48
- Drop your weapon! 
- This way! 
Fuck! 
Hey, interpol! Interpol! 
Fuck! 
Shit! 
Hurry! 
Fuck! 
Fuck! 
Okay. 
A loose helmet 
is like wearing no helmet at all. It's not a button strap. It's a d-ring. Just unthread it through 
the thing. It's very simple. 
Well... or there's... 
there's that shortcut. 
I ask you one time, polite. 
Where is Kincaid? 
Honestly, I'd tell you if I knew. You have my word. Look at my right hand. See that? That's a boy scout salute. We're sworn to never lie. 
I've taken an oath, so you can trust... right in the fucking ear! 
Really? Waterboarding? Really? 
I was in the CIA. You know, 
we don't do that anymore. 
Okay. Hey, hey. Hold it. 
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. 
Here's what we learned. 
The key to interrogation 
is establishing a bond 
between the interrogator 
and the subject, okay? 
You know, just sort of 
like a rapport, okay? 
You need me to like you. 
You need me to like you, okay? 
You need me to like you! 
I really don't like you. 
Okay, okay, okay 
where is Kincaid? 
He's right behind you. 
Page 35/48
Scout's honor. 
[9unshofl 
[9unshofl 
[9unshofl 
oh, my god! 
Fuck! 
Hey, listen, before you start talking, 'cause I know you're gonna 
start fucking talking, 
I just want to apologize 
for laughing about popping kurosawa. I know that shit 
cost you your girl and that... 
Fake-ass, made-up triple-a shit - you keep talking about. 
- No, no, no... 
No, it was all my fault. 
No... I did it all to myself. 
Bryce, please! Come on, 
you didn't do it to yourself. 
That's life. Life happens. 
Life without Amelia. 
Hey, still time to work that shit out. So, how'd you and agent roussel meet? On a job. 
She was... 
She was working an undercover op, very badly. 
I was at a client's funeral. 
Massive heart attack. 
I can protect someone 
from bullets and explosives, 
but there's nothing I can do 
against indiscriminate use of mayonnaise for 68 straight years. 
Technically, I was still on the payroll, so I was in the building, 
paying my respects. 
Amelia was there 
with some of her other interpol agents. They were hoping to bust my client's shady and mayonnaise-chugging brother. Instead of doing things nice and quiet, they got marked, and their target runs. 
Page 36/48
Oh, yeah. 
Leave it to interpol to turn 
a really fun funeral 
with lots of delicious hors d'oeuvres into a depressing carnival show 
of total unprofessionalism. 
Just kind of bumped into her. 
See, that's what I'm talking about. It just happened! 
You didn't plan it, deduce it, 
or Google running 
into the girl of your dreams. 
You just bumped into her, 
the same way I just bumped into kurosawa. You know, when life gives you shit, you make kool-aid. 
That's not really 
how that expression works. 
Yeah, and that's the beauty 
of that motherfucker: Life. 
Ah. Yeah, well, life, I mean... 
Life doesn't usually give you shit, and then turn into a beverage. 
That's not... at least 
where I'm from, that's not how it works. Look, motherfucker, 
you don't have to explain 
- every goddamn thing that goes on in life! - If it gives you lemons... 
Okay? You don't need a reason 
for that shit. 
you would make lemonade. 
Just shut the fuck up! 
It just doesn't work that way. 
Breaking news from the hague 
suggests that if a credible witness cannot be produced 
within the next hour, 
the former president of Belarus, 
Vladislav dukhovich, 
will walk free and resume power. 
This would be a spectacular embarrassment for the international community 
and a crushing blow 
Page 37/48

for the many relatives... 
They're out there, 
waiting for us to make the first move. I know I would be. 
I should've told Amelia. 
Told her what? 
That I'm a stupid man. 
Hey... what if I told you 
I couldn't protect you? 
I'd say you're right. 
We'll just go to Amsterdam, 
I'll help you get Sonia out, 
and you give her those flowers in person. No fucking way. 
I gotta help you get back 
that triple-a shit I fucked up. Guilt's killing me. 
Dukhovich, that motherfucker's gotta go. Well, it's not gonna happen 
unless we get there. 
Shit, I'd bet on them. 
Normally I would, too. 
I got a hot tip. 
There's a couple of ringers in the game. We got our choice of wheels. 
That's a good-looking jag. 
Yeah. I guarantee 
you if that smells like ass, 
it's supermodel ass. 
- Really? 
- Oh yeah. 
She blends right in. 
- Whoa! 
- Fuck! 
That's responsive! 
Jesus. No! I have... I have a pen knife. It's just that the gearshift's 
on the right-hand side here, 
and I'm not used to that. 
It's practically impossible... 
Get out of the fucking car. 
A three-day adjustment period 
to figure this out. 
- I will bust a cap in your ass, Page 38/48

- the clutch... 
if you don't give up that wheel. Have you ever said please 
- or thank you... 
- Please, motherfucker! 
Why are we always yelling? 
- Get out of the fucking car! 
- Fine! 
Time's just about up. 
No sign. They vanished in Amsterdam. Dukhovich is free. 
Michael would never let that happen. It appears you're wrong 
about your Michael Bryce. 
Hello? 
Hey. 
Michael, where are you? 
We're a couple minutes out. 
Look. 
I wanna tell you that I'm sorry. I wanna say that I'm sorry 
for, um, for everything. 
For kurosawa, us, it's all my fault. You know, I act like a... 
I act like a fucking child around you. I can't admit that it's my fault, and I project that onto you, 
and, you know, that's not fair. You deserve better than that. 
Why are you telling me this now? Well, under the circumstances, it seemed like a good time. 
We got company. 
Huh? 
Let's go! 
Amelia. 
Amelia. 
Just want to say that... 
L "love".You. 
Jesus Christ! Really? 
What happened to the seatbelt rule? Fuck! 
- Look... 
- move your fucking car! 
Page 39/48

Hurry! Over here! 
Michael? 
- Michael? 
- W ho this? 
Hello? 
Agent roussel, hold on, 
let me put you on speaker. 
What happened to Michael? 
He had to bounce. 
- Excuse me. Sorry. 
- Hey! 
You know, he really cares about you. He has a hard time 
processing emotions and shit. 
But one thing his fucked-up 
brain has figured out, 
is he really loves you. 
Are you in the middle of something? Well, actually, yeah, I am. 
Look, we'll call you back. 
Follow me, hurry! Pass me the magazine. Watch out! 
Okay, gentlemen... 
Fuck! 
If you wouldn't mind... 
The gun. 
Yes. 
Thank you. 
Yo! You about done? 
Tick took, motherfucker! 
He's fucking unkillable. 
Fuck. 
With just 
five minutes remaining 
before the court's deadline, 
the case against Vladislav dukhovich is almost certainly doomed. 
Suspicious vehicle 
is approaching, commander. 
Stop the car! 
What's going on here? 
Is this what we've been waiting for? Shit. 
I got your witness, Darius Kincaid. Page 40/48

Follow me. 
Obviously, your honor, 
this has devolved into a complete waste of my client's time. 
The prosecution has no witness to present. Can you empty 
your pockets, please, sir. 
Are you kidding me? Come on! 
As we seem to be reaching our deadline, I have no choice but to declare 
that this trial has come to its natural... Your honor, I present Darius Kincaid. The deadline has passed! 
I believe we still had 
a few seconds on the clock. 
How do I look? 
You got a little speck of blood on your... Everywhere. 
Will the prosecution 
please prepare their witness. 
- Hi. 
- My god, are you okay? 
Yeah. There's your guy. 
- Thank you. 
- Yeah. 
By the way, bumping into you 
is the best thing 
that ever happened to me. 
Do you swear to tell the truth, 
the whole truth, 
and nothing but the truth? 
Yeah. 
Your name is Darius Kincaid? 
No. My real name is Darius Evans. My parents separated when I was six. My mother remarried 
a real mean piece of work 
named Roger Kincaid. 
She figured if I took his name, 
he'd keep his belt on more often. Plan didn't work so well, 
but the name stuck. 
My real father's name 
is Maurice Evans, preacher. 
Page 41/48
He was killed a few years later 
in his own church. 
I'm sorry, I didn't... 
That's all right. 
Can't research everything. 
Mr. Kincaid, were you ever 
in the employ of Vladislav dukhovich? No. 
Have you ever met dukhovich? 
Yes. April 17, 2012, 
he invited me to his palace. 
Prosecution exhibit 
17-d, palace security logs. 
Did he offer you employment then? Yes, he did. 
He wanted me to take out 
a political rival exiled in the uk. - I refused. 
- Why? 
Because while I was 
there, he ordered his men 
to slaughter a village outside polotsk. I'm not down with killing innocent people. And do you have evidence 
to corroborate this? 
Yeah. 
Go to ftp site raven 257. 
Just load it up. 
Exhibit 18-d. 
We've confirmed the coordinates. It's asking for a password. 
Sorry. Password... 
"Dukhovich is a dick," all caps, except "dick" is lower case. 
I wasn't gonna trust 
interpol with this shit. 
Order! 
Order! 
Order in the court! 
Your honors, 
I could save us all some time. 
May I address the court? 
For months, I have been 
sitting in this chair, 
Page 42/48
nodding along to this ludicrous charade. Excuse me. 
My excellent attorney 
was hoping 
for the legitimacy of a formal acquittal, but that is no longer possible. Thank you, Darius. 
So, let us now end the charade. The charges against me 
are entirely correct. 
I am the rightful ruler of Belarus! - Sit down! Order! 
- As the ruler of my nation, 
I will do as I wish without exception, without apology. 
- Sit down! Order! 
- I recognize no authority 
- that limits my power! 
- Mr. dukhovich, I order you... Assistant director. 
Go do your job, Amelia! 
In this trial... 
The world community 
is attempting to make a statement! Well, now I would like to make 
a statement of my own! 
Show me your phone. 
I recognize no authority 
that limits my powers! 
Everybody go! 
I will now take my leave 
with my dignity intact! 
Now, that's what 
I call triple-a service. 
Fuck! 
Fuck! Medic! Medic! 
I need a medic over here! 
- Lockdown protocol! 
- Don't move! 
We're here live in front 
of the icc in the hague 
where a truck bomb has just plowed into a crowd of protesters. 
Emergency! 
Page 43/48
It's a critical health situation! We need immediate air and ground support! Focus on me, Bryce. 
Bryce! Focus on me. 
I'd really rather not. 
in effect. 
All units. All units. 
Stay with me, Bryce. Stay with me. I did my job. You go do yours. 
Gotta go get that motherfucker! Freeze! On your knees. 
tower, airmed one requests 
priority clearance 
to restricted zone bravo 
for casualty extraction. 
Officer, the building is in lockdown. Dukhovich does not leave his cell. Let's go! 
It's over, assistant director. 
Give up. 
I didn't want to do this, Amelia. I swear to you. 
Igunshofl 
fuck! 
Michael! Michael! 
- Michael, you hear me? 
- Are you okay? Yeah? 
- Yeah. Yeah. 
- Good, good, good. 
- You? 
- Yeah. 
Oh, no. You're bleeding. 
Oh, no, no, no. 
I'll get some help. 
Stay here. 
Hey! 
Hey! 
Up on the ledge, dookie man. 
You heard me, bitch! Up on the ledge! The look on your face. 
You're so proud. 
Darius Kincaid, 
about to be a hero, save the day. None of that matters. 
Page 44/48

There is no redemption, 
no atonement for a man like you. Your whole life has been 
but a trail of corpses, 
and I will be just another 
dead body on the pile! 
Go ahead! 
Finish me! 
But don't think for a moment 
it will change what you are. 
I don't give a fuck about all of that! You fucked up 
when you shot my bodyguard. 
Who? 
Dukhovich. 
That's dukhovich. 
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. Celebrity security. 
It's low stress. 
Boy bands and shit, right? 
One of those guys gets killed, 
nobody's getting all that mad at me. Well, we'll figure it out. 
We will? 
Yo! What a brother gotta do 
to get arrested up in this bitch? Can't someone just taser him? 
I mean, like, a non-lethal taser. Director casoria. My deal still good? You definitely held up 
your end, Mr. Kincaid. 
Agent roussel, why don't you go find Mr. Kincaid some handcuffs. 
With pleasure. 
You were right to trust your instincts. Well done. 
Thank you, ma'am. 
- You're welcome. 
- For what? 
I got you a front row seat 
to the roussel show, 
and I got you that all-access 
backstage pass 
- to that ass you've been wanting so bad. Page 45/48

- You did what? 
You jumped out of the car, 
I gave her the 411 on you. 
I didn't jump out of the... 
i went through the fucking windshield. Semantics. 
Semantics? 
Semantics. Yeah, just another way of saying the same thing... 
I know what semantics means. 
I also know that I don't need 
love advice from you. 
Oh, really? So tell me 
how that love life shit 
was going before I showed up. 
You know, she's gonna be 
right back, and that's it. 
Last chance to run. 
I'm going along with 
the program till Sonia's free. Then I do my thing. 
You really think 
it's gonna be that easy, do you? Motherfucker, please. 
You know when I want 
some shit to pop, it pops. 
Like that shot 
through that tittie-small window - on kurosawa's plane. 
- That's enough. 
- Okay, that's enough out of you. - Show me the face you made 
- when that shit went down. 
- That still stings. 
I know you wasn't 
expecting that shit to happen. Yeah, I was expecting you 
to blow my client's head off. 
Did you have that home alone 
face thingy, like... 
Do you guys have handcuffs? 
Do you have any? 
A worldwide 
red notice was issued today 
Page 46/48
for contract killer Darius Kincaid. Kincaid has escaped 
from her majesty's prison, belmarsh. The notorious hitman 
is almost certainly armed 
and considered extremely dangerous. Oh, baby... 
It's so romantic 
that you broke out of prison 
for our anniversary. 
No way was I gonna miss it

Ay, mi cucaracha.

Hold the roll, please. 
Sorry, Ryan. 
Just waiting on church bells, mate. Where are they coming from? 
Where are they coming from? 
Still rolling. 
All right, send Max, 
send Max down, would you? 
Max, go find out 
what the fuck is going on down there. Jesus, is this the director's cut?

Any progress, Eric? 
Sorry, Professor Kaufman. There's still 
something wrong with the program. 
We can't do any more experiments 
with the laser until you boys fix it. 
We know. We know. 
Hey, wait! I've found something. 
- What? 
- Who turned on the laser? 
Not me! 
- Shut it down! 
- I can't! It's not responding! 
- What is that? 
- I was hoping you'd know, professor. 
- He's absorbing all our computer data. 
- Call security! 
- Like, are we there yet, Fred? 
- I told you, Shaggy, soon. 
But you said that an hour ago, man. 
It's so impressive that Eric got 
a grant for his computer project. 
Doesn't surprise me. Back in high school, he practically lived in the computer lab. Right, Velma? - Yeah. He's one smart cookie. 
- Cookie? Cookie?! 
Sorry, Scooby. Figure of speech. 
Cheer up, Scoob. When we get there, 
we'll get to play the game Eric designed. - I bet it's way cooler than this one. 
- Yeah, cooler! 
Imagine a computer game starring all of us! Solving mysteries in cyberspace. 
Like, I hope I do better 
on Eric's game than this one. 
Where do you think you're going? 
To visit our friend Eric Staufer. 
He's a student here. 
Not if you're not on my list. 
It should be under "Fred Jones". 
- Is this whole group with you? 
- Yes, sir. 
- Including the dog? 
- Dog? Where? 
There you are. 
Page 2/26
But just so you know... 
...I don't like a bunch of punks 
running around my university. 
- Your university? 
- It might as well be. 
I've been here for 20 years. There's 
never been any trouble on my watch. 
I'm the head of security. 
Wembley's the name. 
- Twenty years is an impressive record. - You bet it is. 
I want to make sure that it stays... 
A wise guy, eh? 
I'm keeping a special eye 
on you, pooch! 
Pooch? 
- Like, Scooby's just playing, officer. - Yeah, sorry. 
We just need some help 
finding the computer lab. 
The lab is three buildings 
down on the left. 
- Thanks. 
- And keep your dog off the grass. 
Wow, Eric, this lab 
is one groovy setup. 
We like it too. 
You don't want to eat those. 
Because they're grown in radioactive soil. Zoinks! 
- Everyone, this is my lab partner, Bill McLemore. - Nice to meet you. 
Thanks for keeping Shaggy and Scooby 
from glowing in the dark. 
- We'll go to dinner after the tour. 
- But first, can you show us your new video game? Scoob and I have been dying to play it. No one is playing the game 
until we get rid of our problem. 
Professor Kaufman, I'd like you to meet the mystery gang I based my game on. 
- Oh, hi! 
- Nice to meet you. 
The famous Mystery, Inc. 
Page 3/26
And that's Scooby-Doo. 
It looks like you showed up 
just in time for a mystery. 
- A mystery? 
- Why? What happened? 
This is a hyper-energy laser. 
We've been using it to break down actual objects and project them into cyberspace. 
Jinkies! You mean you can transport objects from the real world into the computer world? - Precisely, young lady. 
- That's fantastic! 
It was, until the laser beamed 
a monster into our world last night. 
A monster?! 
Yes, the laser beamed a computer virus right here into this lab. 
A really freaky-looking thing. 
He erased all the computers' data 
by just walking near them. 
This virus is also able to control 
and manipulate electrical objects. 
- But where did it come from? 
- Eric's computer game. 
Computer viruses don't just appear. 
They have to be created by someone. 
- But I didn't create it! 
- I'm sure it wasn't Mr. Staufer. 
But whoever created this virus 
is in serious trouble. 
Our civilization is 
so dependent on technology... 
...that this virus is a threat 
to the entire world. 
Can you show us how the laser works? 
You can show the demo, 
but don't start the game! 
Yes, sir. 
Like, check it out! We're digital! 
Yeah! Digital! 
We used the game to extrapolate 
3- D data into quantum particles. 
- Of course, it's so simple! 
- It is? 
Page 4/26
He used the Scooby game as the location in cyberspace to store physical objects. - And you're sure the virus came from the game? - Unfortunately, yes. 
There's no virus in my baseball game, and it's more entertaining. 
Batter up! 
Strike one! 
- Now, this is a game you can get into. - That's really cool, Bill. 
- I'm a huge baseball fan myself. 
- You have good taste, Fred. 
- I think it's the greatest sport in the world. - Baseball's okay... 
- ... but it doesn't have Scooby and me in it. - That's right! 
The Scooby game has 10 levels. 
You battle monsters or villains... 
...while trying to find 
Scooby Snacks on each level. 
Oh, boy! Scooby Snacks! 
Okay, Professor. 
Now, check out the monitor. 
- Cool! 
- Jinkies! 
I wouldn't believe it 
if I didn't see it with my own eyes! Like, I don't believe it either. 
We didn't even get one Scooby Snack. Eric and Bill are sure to win 
the $250,000 grand prize... 
- ... at the international science fair. - Wow, that's some prize. 
It'll be a reward for their talent 
and hard work on the laser project. 
We couldn't have done it without you, prof. Kaufman. You should share the reward too. No, no. As a teacher, 
being able to guide young minds... 
...to their full potential 
is reward enough, Eric. 
Speaking of rewards, is it possible to get the Scooby Snacks out of the game? 
- Groovy! 
Page 5/26
- Oh, boy! 
- Hey, that's mine! 
- No, mine! 
Mine! 
Is that the way the virus 
came out of the game, Eric? 
Yeah. It was pretty scary. 
If it's just a computer virus, 
what harm can it do in our world? From what we observed the last night, this virus has the potential... ...to steal every 
computer program in the world. 
And the virus made the telephone come to life, which attacked Eric. It kept coming toward us 
and we couldnt't stop it. 
When I held up a magnetic bar 
in defense... 
... it seemed to have 
an adverse effect on the virus. Yeah. It seemed like the magnet weakened him. Like kryptonite to Superman. - Wow! 
- Creepy! 
The security guards checked the campus, but couldn't find him anywhere. I suspect that he is still 
in this building somewhere. 
Still here? 
No more arguing, boys. 
So what can we do to help, Eric? If you can lure the Phantom Virus into the lab... 
...I can use the laser to beam him back into cyberspace. 
Great. Like, you want us 
to be virus bait? 
- Like, no way, man. 
- Uh-uh. 
Would you do it for a Scooby Snack? Hold on, Scoob. Only one Scooby Snack to go chase a phantom? 
I don't think so. 
Page 6/26
What if I gave you each 
two Scooby Snacks? 
Okay, you got a deal. 
Go long, guys! 
This place is so big, we'll probably never see this virus anyway. 
How do we capture the Phantom Virus once we find him? 
The Phantom Virus is composed 
of electromagnetic energy. 
Get close enough to him 
with one of these super-magnets... ...and it will render him helpless. Be careful, Scooby. 
Those are pretty strong magnets. Sorry! 
- Now let's really put them to the test. - I knew I could count on you guys. This building is so big! 
This Phantom Virus could be anywhere. I think we stand a better chance of finding it if we split up. 
Hey, you guys, I didn't say how 
we were gonna split up. 
Like, do we ever do it any other way? Do we really have to look in the basement? We have to search the whole building, top to bottom. 
This stuff looks like it should be in the Smithsonian. 
Why do they bother keeping this old junk? Oh, I don't know. Some of this 
old junk could be very valuable. Jinkies! It's him! 
- Uh-oh! 
- Watch out! 
The magnets! 
Get back, you... creepy... thingy! "Creepy thingy"? 
You'll pay for this! 
We don't think so. 
Thingy! 
After him! 
- I wonder why they left? 
Page 7/26
- I don't know. 
Man, it's bad enough we're 
always chasing real ghosts. 
Now we're chasing 
computer-generated ones. 
It's a good thing phantoms 
don't care about lunch. 
Santa Claus! 
I think we lost him. 
Wait! Look! 
What do we do? 
Get as close to him as possible 
with our magnets. 
Ready? One, two, three! 
I thought I heard 
some noise down here. 
What are you kids doing? 
The basement's for staff only. 
We're hunting for the Phantom Virus. Yeah, I heard about 
this so-called virus. 
I think it's some kind of a college prank. No, Officer Wembley. You see, we... You kids are coming with me back 
to Kaufman's lab. 
Can you believe the cafeteria 
ran out of food? 
- And we're still hungry. 
- Yeah. Hungry! 
I think I saw a vending machine 
down the hall. 
What is it, Scoob? 
Oh, hello, Mr. Phantom. 
Zoinks! 
Thank you for volunteering 
for our experiment, Mr. Virus. 
- Nurse, take the patient over to the table. - Okay. This way, please. 
Sit down. 
Just relax. 
Now, can you tell us how many layers are in an ideal club sandwich? 
Time's up. The correct answer is, 
"Never enough! " 
Page 8/26

Let's try one more. 
When's the best time to enjoy 
a milkshake with your french fries? Time's up. The answer is, "Anytime! " Yikes! 
I'm worried about Shaggy and Scooby. They've been gone for a long time. Maybe we should go look for them. 
Nobody goes anywhere 
until Professor Kaufman gets back. - What was that? 
- It's the Phantom! 
Jinkies! It looks like we've been 
beamed into Eric's computer game. 
- What? 
- The laser's been fired. 
At that Phantom Virus, I hope. 
I don't think so. Look here. 
Your friends have been transported into cyberspace! 
So? Throw a switch or something 
and get them out. 
But thing doesn't work that way. They have to play through all the levels to get out. - You're kidding me. 
- I wish he was. 
Until they can get out 
by winning every level of the game... - ... the danger is very real. 
- Danger? 
Check this out. I'm, like, a superhero! Be careful, Shaggy. 
There's less gravity on the moon. 
Look! It's Super-Shaggy! 
Scooby, could you get Shaggy back here before he hurts himself? 
Scooby-Dooby-Doo! 
Nice try, Scoob! 
Like, catch me if you can. 
- Shaggy, are you all right? 
- I think so. 
- But I made an important discovery. - What's that? 
In this video game, you can get hurt. Page 9/26

Or worse. We'd better be careful. 
Velma's right. Eric said this game has creatures and who knows what else. Zoinks! I know who! 
- Oh, no! 
- He must've gotten beamed into the game too. Yikes! Help! 
Oh, no! He's not alone. 
Let's play ball! 
Like, let's not! 
- I thought we were chasing him. 
- Back at the lab, we were. 
- But here in the game, he's got friends. - They don't look very friendly to me. I think we lost them. 
You know, getting beamed into cyberspace might not be such a bad thing. 
- And how's that, Velma? 
- Yeah! 
Maybe if we play along, we can 
find out who created this virus. 
Right! Maybe we can find some clues. Remember what Eric said? 
We need to find the box of Scooby Snacks. And, like, there it is! 
Wow, that was easy. 
It's only the first level of the game. It's supposed to be easy. 
Over there! 
Oh, no! Here they come! 
- Look, a rover! 
- Huh? 
- A moon rover! 
- And what a cool paint job! 
Come on, guys! 
This thing needs new shocks! 
As long as it gets us away 
from those moon goons, who cares? 
Oh, no! They've got 
a set of wheels too! 
Zoinks! 
Step on it, Freddy! They're gaining on us! I am, but this is as fast as it goes. Man, he got us! 
Page 10/26

It's okay, guys. 
The Scooby Snacks are right there. Oh, boy! Scooby Snacks! 
Scooby-Dooby-Doo! 
Go, Scooby, go! 
Yikes! 
Stop that dog! 
Come on, Scoob! You can do it, pal! - Hi! 
- Watch out! 
What happened to...? 
- What? 
- Where are we now? 
If I'm not mistaken, 
we're inside the Roman Colosseum. 
- Colosseum? 
- Like, where they play football? 
Not exactly. In ancient Rome... 
...people used to gather in the Colosseum to watch all kinds of events. 
You mean like sports and music? 
Yeah, they did that too. But the Colosseum is famous as the place... 
...where Romans fed people 
to the lions for lunch. 
- Lions? 
- Well, it looks deserted now. 
Speaking of lunch, we didn't even get to keep the Scooby Snacks from the moon level. Don't worry, Scoob. I bet there's 
a concession stand somewhere. 
- What's this? 
- What are these white lines for? 
Like, it's chalk! 
Yikes! Virus! 
Welcome to level two, game players, where things get a little tougher. But first, let me introduce you 
to the home team! 
Those guys look like 
they've got a bone to pick, huh, Scoob? Don't worry, gang. We can beat 
those meatless gladiators. 
And now for the home team's mascot. Page 11/26

The lion's got the Scooby Snacks! You know, for once, I'm not in the mood for Scooby Snacks. 
Me neither! 
Yikes! 
- Good idea, Scooby! 
- Come on, Shaggy! 
- Are you all right, Shaggy? 
- Yeah. But I'm really tangled up. - A chariot. 
- Good thinking, Scoob! 
Thank you. 
Faster, Scoob! Faster! 
Yikes! Like, hit the turbo, Scoob! Good work, guys! You handle the gladiators, and we'll take care of this lion. How exactly are we going to do that? - Give me your jacket. 
- But I just bought this. 
- Daphne! 
- Oh, all right. 
Here. 
I know this isn't red, 
but it'll have to do. 
Toro! Toro! 
Leo! Leo! 
Ol! 
- That was too close. 
- I have an idea. 
Leo! Leo! 
Now! 
Way to go, girls! 
- Thanks. 
- This will hold him. 
- That was very brave, Freddy. 
- Thanks. 
Here's your jacket. 
Shaggy and Scooby need our help! 
Come on! 
Zoinks! 
Good going, guys! 
Yeah, whatever. 
Keep those gladiators busy just a little bit longer. I'll get the Scooby Snacks. 
Page 12/26
- That's easy for you to say, man. - Yeah! 
- Try to lead them up into the stands. - I don't think we have the energy. But, maybe we do! 
- Here. 
- What are we supposed to do with these? - Use them to pole-vault over the wall. - Like, and then what? 
Never mind. 
Friends, Romans and spooky gladiators. All hail Emperor Scooby! 
So where are we now? 
- Looks like a jungle of some kind. - It's gorgeous here. 
I'll say. This place beats 
ancient Rome any day, eh, Scoob? Oh, no! This is a prehistoric jungle! I take back what I said. 
Rome is lovely this time of year. Look over there! 
What's that?! 
How's this for a heavy hitter? 
Jinkies! He's riding a T. rex! 
Let's head for the trees. 
It's too thick for them to follow. - That was a close one. 
- They're doing pretty good so far. I'm wondering something here, fellas. Who activated that laser and sent those poor kids into the game? 
Who knows? Could be anyone. 
Even someone in this very room. We hiked through miles of jungle and still can't find the Scooby Snacks! We'd better, otherwise we'll 
be stuck in this level forever. All I know is that this virus likes to scare us in cyberspace... 
...as much as in the real world. Nice work, guys. Which one of you did the drawing over there? 
- Not me. 
- Not me. 
Page 13/26

- It looks like a volcano. 
- I wonder if it means anything. Oh, no! The fire's going out. 
It's gonna be dark in a few hours, too. Scooby and Shaggy, it's your turn to get the firewood. 
- All right. Come on, Scoob. 
- Okay. 
Like, just a few more sticks, 
and we can head back, Scoob. 
- Smoke! 
- Smoke? 
Zoinks! Up there! 
Like, all the trees are burning! Like, where did that come from? 
Volcano. 
Forget the wood, Scoob. 
We've gotta warn the others. 
What happened, guys? 
Where's the firewood? 
Like, if we don't get out of here soon, we're all gonna be firewood. 
- What are you talking about, Shaggy? - Volcano! 
Volcano? 
Great! It looks like 
it's really cooking. 
I bet that's where 
the Scooby Snacks are. 
That drawing is a clue 
to lead us to the Scooby Snacks! But it's miles away. 
It'll take us hours to get there! - Where there's a will, there's... - Woolly mammoths? 
Mammoths didn't live in the same age as dinosaurs, but I'm not complaining! I am! I wish Eric had put 
saddles on these guys. 
I can't take much more of this. 
I wish he'd made them 
smell better too. 
- How are you guys doing? 
- Like, do you have an airsickness bag? Page 14/26

Well, hang on, guys. 
We're almost there. 
- Any sign of the Scooby Snacks? - Like, all I can see is smoke. And lava! 
Look up there! 
- That poor baby pterodactyl's trapped. - Poor little guy. 
- The volcano's erupting again. - No. We've got company! 
Start climbing! 
Yikes! 
I think we're safe. T. rex is built for running, not climbing. 
Look! The mama pterodactyl 
is trying to save its baby. 
- Hey! Where are you going, Scoob? - Be careful, Scooby! 
Hello! 
Scooby Snacks! 
He found the Scooby Snacks! 
I think we're finally home. 
No more monsters chasing us. 
Let's celebrate with some chow. It might be a little early 
for a celebration, gang. 
Look. 
Aw, man, we're still in the game. And I thought we were home free. Okay. They've made it to the last level. But this one's the toughest of all. No player's ever won it. Not even me. It'll take everything they've got just to survive. 
So now what? 
All we have to do is find 
the last box of Scooby Snacks. 
But this city is so big. 
Where do we start? 
Let's see if that woman 
knows anything. 
- Excuse us, ma'am, we were wondering... - Surprise! 
- The virus! 
Page 15/26
- Welcome to the final level. 
You're in the major leagues now. 
Run! 
- Like, where are we going? 
- Hey, let's hide in the malt shop. 
Great idea, Freddy! 
Can someone help us? 
Zoinks! 
- You're me. 
- And, like, you're me. 
- You're the characters in Eric's video game! - And you're from the real world. 
Jinkies! 
Did I really wear that years ago? 
That jacket with that skirt? 
- Nice ascot. 
- Works for me. 
I guess it's been a while since we've seen Eric. He hasn't seen our fashion changes. 
- We'll go shopping later. 
- Like, why don't you join us for a little snack? Man, I thought you'd never ask! 
Here you go, pal. 
Thanks a lot. 
We don't have time to play around. We need to find the Scooby Snacks and get out of here. - You guys need to relax. 
- Yeah! What are you worried about? 
Aren't you afraid 
of the Phantom Virus? 
Phantom who? 
Never heard of him. 
- You're kidding. 
- Oh, I get it. 
The virus isn't part of this game. 
He has no reason to look 
for our cyber doubles. 
You cyber-guys are lucky. 
The Phantom Virus is creepy 
and has this really scary laugh. 
Just like that. 
Come out and play! 
It's him! 
Come out, come out. 
Page 16/26
Let's get out of here. 
The Mystery Machine's out back. 
- I'll drive. 
- I'll drive. 
This is nostalgic. 
I miss this old van. 
In cyber-world, 
things never get old. It's pretty cool. There's a lot to like in cyber-world. 
Stores, theaters, parks... and lots of tasty food. What about the monsters and villains? 
We haven't seen any. 
They're probably guarding the Scooby Snacks. You mean you guys don't know 
where the Scooby Snacks are? 
We know where they are. There's just 
no reason to go after them. 
Because even if we get the Scooby Snacks, we just go right back to the beginning of the game. And we like it here. 
Until you guys showed up 
with that Phantom Virus, that is. 
- We'd gladly get rid of him for you. 
- If we could. 
You know, 
if all ten of us team up... 
...the Phantom Virus 
wouldn't stand a chance. 
I guess we were gonna go 
after the snacks eventually. 
- So you'll help? 
- Count us in. 
Well then, let's go. 
Well, here we are. 
Man, this place is awesome! 
So where are the Scooby Snacks? 
On the Scooby game, of course. 
Right inside the video arcade. 
What's that sound? 
There it is again. 
- Baseball. 
- Cyber-Scooby is right. 
There's a batting cage over there. 
Wow, that guy is really 
Page 17/26

clobbering the ball. 
Hey, man. Great swing. 
Thanks! Want my autograph? 
Let's play ball! 
Everybody make a run 
for the video arcade! 
Creeper! 
- Jeepers! It's the Creeper! 
- The what? 
- He's one of the villains from our past. - And he's got a pet. 
It's Jaguaro. 
He's supposed to be in Brazil. 
Gator Ghoul and the Tar Monster? Head for the beach! 
No way. Look! 
It's Old Iron Face! 
Man, you guys know 
some strange people. 
It's like every villain 
we've ever faced is here! 
Maybe we shouldn't have told Eric so much about our mysteries. 
How right you are, my dear. 
Wait a minute. 
All these creatures in the real world turned out to be just people in costumes. Velma's right. They were all fakes. Nice try, Phantom Virus. 
But you can't fool us. 
Tough time with the mask, guys? He's real! 
That means that they're all real! Creeper! 
Yikes! 
Get them! 
Let's split up, gang. 
- Right. 
- Okay, Freddy. 
Step right up and test your strength. How about you, handsome? 
- Me? 
- Yes, you, sir! 
Let us show you how easy it is. Page 18/26

Creepy. Why'd you pick 
this place to hide? 
Me? I was following you. 
If you thought this wasn't a good place, you should've said something. 
Where did that come from? 
These fun houses have 
all sorts of trap doors. 
Let's keep an eye open for more. Oh, no! 
What's wrong? 
- Look how fat I am! 
- It's just a trick mirror. 
- You look perfect. 
- Oh, thanks. You too. 
Creeper! 
- Keep away from us! 
- What do we do? 
Sorry. You're not our type. 
Creeper. 
Way to go, girl! 
He's climbing back up! 
That door won't hold him long. 
Hey! Where are you? 
Come on! 
- Is he still behind us? 
- Yep. 
That walking handbag 
will reach us any minute now. 
Look! 
- What do we do now? 
- Jump! 
- What?! We must be five stories high! - Down there! 
One, two, three. Go! 
That was some jump. 
But it beats getting eaten 
by an alligator. 
Just barely. 
See you later, alligator! 
- These wax figures are pretty creepy. - At least they're not real. 
Hey, what's that? 
This must be where 
Page 19/26

they make the wax figurines. 
That one looks like... 
Old Iron Face! Jinkies! 
Let's get out of here. 
- Oh, no! My glasses! 
- Mine too! 
- Thanks. 
- Thanks. 
The wax is hardening. He can't move. 
Yes, he can. Let's get out of here! 
Great work, Scoobs. 
Don't be scared. It's just us. 
I thought we lost him. 
Go, Shaggys! 
- The Tar Monster is right behind us. - And boy, is he mad! 
Let's get out of here! 
Look. 
- Bye-bye! 
- Bye-bye! 
- Scooby-Doos! 
- Where are you? 
I wonder where they are. 
- Over here. 
- There they are! 
Come on, Scooby. 
Now that we're all here, 
we've got one last monster to face. 
The Phantom Virus. 
And this is the final level, 
so the virus won't be easy to beat. 
What's this? Zoinks! 
I've still got the magnet 
Professor Kaufman gave me. 
You had that magnet with you 
all this time and forgot about it? 
Guess I was too busy being scared. 
What's wrong with cyber-Shag? 
What's going on here? 
The cyber-gang is made of electromagnetic energy and therefore affected by the magnet. Just like the Phantom Virus. 
- What's this about a magnet? 
- We have a way to beat the virus now. Page 20/26

And we know he's guarding 
the Scooby Snacks in there. 
- We need your gang to stay here. - You don't want us help to help you? We wouldn't want you 
to get hurt by the magnet again. - Magnet? What are you talking about? - Oh, never mind. 
Man, this is one great video arcade. - Just keep an eye open for the virus. - Look. There's the Scooby-Doo video game. - And the Scooby Snacks! 
- Oh, boy! Scooby Snacks! 
Yikes! 
Like, I hear him, but I don't see him. Ready to play some games? 
Shaggy, the magnet! 
Oh, right! 
- You need to get closer! 
- Like, that's easy for you to say. - Then toss the magnet over here. - With pleasure. 
Hey, Mr. Zappy! 
It's working! Scooby, go grab the snacks. Okay. 
Hurry, Scooby! I don't know how much longer this is gonna work! 
Oh, no! 
Oh, tough break. 
- Freddy! 
- Freddy! 
Not again! 
If you thought my hitting was good... ...wait till you see my pitching. What do we do now? 
- Looks like they're in trouble! - Like, we've gotta do something. Right! Let's go help them. 
Oh, no! They're back! 
Oh, no! 
Scooby? 
- Cyber-Scooby? 
- That's right! 
It's no use. 
Page 21/26

We need some wire cutters. 
- I got an idea. Want to help? 
- Okay. 
Great. Here's the plan. 
Over here. 
What are you doing, Scooby? 
Scooby, get back here! 
You're down to your final out. 
I've never seen Scooby so brave. 
Oh, I get it! That's Cyber-Scooby. And that's old Scoob 
going for the snacks. 
Meddling canine! 
Yikes! 
Help! 
All right, Scoob! 
You did it! 
You beat the Phantom Virus. 
Great job, guys! 
It looks like we're leaving. 
Are you sure you want to split? 
There's a lot of cyber-buffets to try. Yeah! Okay! 
Sorry, but we have to go. 
- I guess this is goodbye. 
- Bye! 
Thanks for all the help! 
Bye, Scooby. 
You're back! I thought you'd be 
stuck in the game forever. 
There's no place like home. 
- Everyone okay? 
- I think so. 
Well done! You've saved the world 
from a terrible menace. 
- But did you find out who created the virus? - We've got a pretty good idea. 
Good. Because whoever created 
the virus must be punished. 
Glad you agree, Professor, because you're as much a suspect as anyone here. 
What? Me? But I'm a scientist! 
I've dedicated my life 
to my students and this university. Page 22/26

But you also stood to make $250,000 
at the science fair. 
If you stole the invention. 
Preposterous! 
And let's not forget Officer Wembley. 
What? I'm an officer 
of the law! Sort of. 
Anyway, I've never committed 
a crime in my life! 
You were the only person that was with us in the lab when we got sent into the game. But once inside the game, 
we found some important clues. 
Our first clue came when we were on the moon level. The Phantom Virus shouted, "Play ball! " And on the Colosseum level, we found some chalk lines like a large diamond. 
But our biggest clue 
was on the final level. 
When the Phantom Virus 
appeared in a batting cage. 
All I'm getting is that the virus 
had a thing for... Baseball! 
Bill! 
Not so fast, kid! 
Okay, son, it's all over. 
- Bill, you were my best friend. 
- And my best student. 
- But you didn't pick my project. 
- What's that supposed to mean? 
Professor Kaufman chose your video design over mine even though I've been here 2 years longer. Students are all equal, Bill. 
So you invented the Phantom Virus, 
hoping it would scare Eric away. 
That's right. And it worked, 
till you guys showed up. 
You were afraid that we would find out 
who created the virus. 
So you beamed us into cyberspace. 
The prize would've been all mine, 
if it wasn't for... 
Us meddling kids! 
I want to thank you for getting rid 
Page 23/26
of the Phantom Virus. Lunch is on me, guys. - In that case, I'll have another cheeseburger. - Two cheeseburgers! 
No problem. 
I'm sorry you guys got trapped 
in cyberspace. 
- Well, it really wasn't all that bad. - Really? 
Going back in time was really fun. 
You did a great job 
designing all the game levels. 
- Thanks, Daphne. 
- But next time, go easier on the monsters. Hey, Shaggy, I just pulled up the Scooby-Doo video game on my laptop. Want to play? What do you say, Scoob? 
Now that there's 
no creepy virus in the game. 
Haven't you had enough for one day? 
Zoinks! Look! 
What are you doing, Scoob? 
Now that's what I call hacking! 
Hacking and Scooby-Snacking! 
Scooby-Dooby-Doo! 
I may be a bit of a bookworm, 
but I've got a wild side too. 
That's why my favorite part of the 
Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase... 
...was shooting in the prehistoric jungle. It brought out the animal in me. 
This one likes me. 
Look how calm he is. 
Jinkies! 
Thanks, Scooby. 
Hey, Velma, that one likes you too. 
Trying to tam those wolly mammoths 
was like a prehistoric rodeo. 
Shaggy found out what 
it was like to be a real cowpoke. 
And after a little practice, Scooby 
and I started the first cattle drive. My dream of playing 
pro baseball ended pretty early. 
But another dream of mine came true 
Page 24/26
when we made the movie. 
Fred Jones, gladiator. 
- You look so cute in that outfit, Freddy. - Cute? That's not what I was going for. You can beat him, Fred! 
All that Frisbee-playing 
with Shaggy really paid off. 
I was amazed how acting like 
Shaggy helped me during battle. 
I lured my opponents into traps, 
jumped high when I was scared... 
...and most importantly, 
ran really fast. 
Just because I wear nice clothes 
and like to shop... 
doesn't mean I don't have 
a sense of adventure. 
That's why I enjoyed 
shooting at the North Pole. 
Besides, when it's 40 below, 
no one cares what you're wearing. 
- The air is so cold. 
- You gotta keep moving around. 
- Shaggy and Scooby have the right idea. - They're doing Arctic aerobics. 
Like, help! 
- Nice work, Daphne. 
- Now you know why I accessorize. 
If you're exploring the Arctic, 
you need to make sacrifices. 
Your shelter must be practical, 
you need to travel light... 
...and most importantly, 
enjoy the 24 hours of sunlight. 
The part I enjoyed most 
about this movie... 
...was all the time Scooby and I 
got to spend at the arcade. 
Like, there's only one thing I love more than playing games, and that's winning at 'em. One more point and I win. 
Game over, Scoob. Like, I'm the 
air-hockey champion of the world! 
Two out of three? 
Page 25/26
I could have been a better sport, 
or at least not gotten so excited. But when I rubbed it in 
after beating him at free throws... ...Scooby made a winning shot 
of his own. 
Your time, Scoob. What was your favorite part of Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase? The laser. 
Like, I got it. Fire away, Scoob. 
Zoinks! It's amazing what you 
can find on the Web. Eh, Scoob? 
We visited the 
Scooby Snacks home page... 
...found a great Web site 
for dessert... 
...which I found out 
was spelled with two S's. 
And best of all, we got to see 
an old friend, right, Scoob? 
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams 
By Robert Rodriguez 
Page 1/34
Hello, everyone. 
We want to welcome a very special guest to our park today the president's daughter. Big smile. Big smile. Hello, Alexandra. Where's your father? He will be here. l will make sure of it. 
Well, hey there, little miss first lady, l am Dinky Winks, owner of 
this fine establishment. 
You ready to ride the ride and shrill to the thrills, spills, and chills? 
Yes, l am. Right this way. 
Of course, that behind me..... 
The world famous Whippersnapper. 
Guaranteed to make grown men howl 
like a cub woke at weaning time. 
Over on our left... Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. The NerveWracker.... oh-ho, painful. Good fun. On your other left is, uh, well, my personal favorite..... The Vomiter. Now, we tell people not to ride it on a full stomach, but you know folks. 
They just don't listen. 
But... why bother with any of those? You're here for my latest and greatest. For your personal amusement and complete gratification, l humbly offer.... the Juggler. But is it fast? ls it fast? 
Well, let's see, shall we? 
The riders are strapped into the bubble. The hydrobot lifts the 
bubble high into the air. 
And spins it round and round as fast as the United States government will allow. The bubble spins, turns, flips, and bounces. And then...... it juggles you. 
l want to go on. 
l thought so. 
Now, understand the override precautions are top-notch, modified by yours truly. 
l thought her father was supposed to be here. The president has more pressing business than to spend an entire Sunday in a theme park. No one's that busy. 
Page 2/34
Have fun, kid. 
We will take it a little slow, 
just make it fun. 
Mm-hmm. Can't you get her down? 
Somebody's jammed the override. 
Why, that little troublemaker. 
Remain calm. Remain calm. We are the Secret Service. Everything is under control. There's nothing we can do, sir. What? The weight of our agents 
will prevent us from ascending 
the shaky precipice on which she now stands. She will fall. Don't we have any smaller agents? Bring me agents SK1 and SK2. 
Coming through. Coming through. 
We're ready. Use this... the latest gear. We get to keep them afterwards? 
- N... No. Yes. 
- Of course. Let's rock. 
You're sure they can handle this? 
lf not, there are two others who can. Bring me agents SK3 and SK4 as back-up. Ugh. Ugh. We got company. 
Gary and Gerti... 
What are they doing here? Ugh. 
Excuse me there, sport. 
Where did you get that? 
Latest in electro-riser technology, with new composite materials and A.l. brainology. l can see you don't know what l am talking about. Gary, this is my rescue. 
We will take it from here. 
"Latest gear," my butt. 
No, no, no. You will just make it worse. Now you done it. Over here. Get away 
from me. Alexandra, take my hand. 
Back off. I want my father to 
come up here and get me. 
But he's the president of the United States. No, he's my father. 
He was my father before he ever became president, and he should still be my father now. l want him up here. Sir, we have a situation. She's got the Transmooker. 
Page 3/34
This is now a code-red situation. Get her down now. 
The point is, 
you and your father need to have a talk. Up here may not be the best place. Come with me, and l promise you, 
the two of you will have that talk. How can you promise that? l am Level 2. l can order him to talk to you. 
Hi, Gerti. What are you doing? 
l am trying to stop the ride. 
Without disengaging the axis? Exactly. Then stop what you're doing. 
You see, the ride is designed 
to work like a giant magnet. 
lf you reverse the polarization, 
bye-bye, president's daughter. 
See you around. 
Okay. Wait. l took this from my 
father's office this morning. 
l am sure he will want it back. 
Careful. Look, Cortez, you take her down, and l will take this down. 
That way, we both look good. 
l am not doing this for looks, Gary. Thank goodness you're all right, Alexandra. We were worried sick. Oh, boys. 
l think this is what you're looking for. She swiped it from the president. Oh, you're in big trouble this time, missy. Wait a minute. l promised her she could talk to her father. 
Oh, she will talk to him, all right. We will make sure of that. 
- Promise me one thing...... 
- What? 
no more winky-dinky assignments. 
So, you want the Ukata assignment, huh? Your duties are assigned to you by the agency same as everyone, same as me. l know. lt's just that 
we have learned so much. 
Juni and l are more than capable 
of taking bigger assignments. 
Page 4/34
But that's not your decision to make. 
The Spy Kids organization is still new, and if you're a Level 3 or even a Level 2, you cannot go on a mission alone. 
You need more experience. 
Come on. OK, Mom, if you're looking for top secret information, just go straight to the source. Welcome to the Pentagon. 
How did you do that? You can't do that. There is no hacking in this household. 
l know. Sorry. Show me that again. 
l know this hair thing is one of my weakest points. Wait one minute. You're going to look cool. ln fact, you're looking cooler, right? 
Like me. Like Poppy. 
And it's kind of em-o-tion-al to me. 
You know? Uh-oh. A knot. 
We are going to... 
You... Uh-huh, uh-huh. We got it. 
That's my boy. Last touch. 
Hup, hup. You want me to tie it for you? No, it's okay. R.A.L.P.H. can do it. 
Bow tie, R.A.L.P.H., and not too tight. Thanks, R.A.L.P.H. 
lnteresting. But... 
he can never, ever replace..... 
.....me. Pow. 
Not yet, but l think that new 
upgrade comes in next week. Uh-huh. 
- Oh. Only "joking." 
- Hey. 
- Kids. Kids. 
- Kids. Kids. 
"Joking"? 
Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Remember, kids, this is a very important night for your father. And if he's named director of the O.S.S., be sure to stand up and give him a big hug, all right? What if Dad doesn't win? 
Well, then, give him a bigger hug. 
Oh, Yao Ling, Wa Ling, this is Danielle and Dione Daluc. Hello. Hi. 
They created lnfolink, sort of an online trading system for swapping international secrets. 
Page 5/34
- Hi. Oh, hey. 
- Hello. Champagne? 
Can't have any of that. Sorry. 
Something doesn't feel right. 
No wonder your buddy's here. 
Your buddy with the weird laugh. 
He does not have a weird laugh. We were just... talking about you. Really? Wow. You look great, Carmen. 
You want to dance? Sure. 
l don't think that's a good idea, Gary. Family rules say you need to 
ask my father's permission. 
You know, you should have 
had that suit tailored, Juni. 
lt's bunching up around your gut, 
and it makes your head look way too big. You have to excuse my little brother. He's still a little upset 
about the... Juggler incident. 
A good agent controls his temper. 
Just be glad my dad isn't here. He gets really psycho about this sort of thing. Hi, Dad. Um, you remember Gary. 
He's in our organization. 
l was just asking your daughter for a dance. You know how to dance? Fairly well, sir. What kind of dances? All types of dances. What about tango? Yes. Mambo? Fairly well. Rumba? Yes. Cha-cha-cha? Seven steps. Bossa nova? Mm-hmm. Merengue? Of course. What about waltz? 
Y... Yeah, l can waltz. Show me. 
"Right." 
Something like that. 
All right. You can go to dance. 
Watch your older sister. 
Alexandra? Yes? 
What are you doing in there? Dancing. Do you always carry this 
many Secret Service around? 
My dad's idea.... 
he's gotten a little..... paranoid. Well, would you dance... with me? No. 
Page 6/34
All right, hold on a second, guys. 
Level 2.... break it up. 
Why not? 
l only dance... ballet. 
What an incredible coincidence. 
So do l. 
Well, Juni, l must say, 
you're a man of many talents. 
One tries. 
Uh, could you find your seats? 
We're ready to start. 
"I must go." 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
the president of the United States. Thank you. 
l am proud of the O.S.S. and their 
newly formed Spy Kids division. 
For their outstanding 
accomplishments yesterday. 
Gary and Gerti Giggles 
not only saved my daughter... 
What is he talking about? 
l saved her. Juni. But.... 
...more importantly, if not most importantly, they safely retrieved the Transmooker device that my daughter accidentally took from my office earlier that day. 
Now it is my great pleasure to announce the new director of the O.S.S.... 
.......Donnagon Giggles. 
Gary and Gerti Giggles are the kind of agents we need to turn the O.S.S. around. l am proud to award them 
these Level 1 badges, 
What? Which will enable them 
to take on real missions, 
something challenging, 
like the Ukata assignment. Yes. 
l wanted that assignment. 
This is so unfair. 
l am proud to claim them as our organization's top Spy Kid operatives. Something's not right. And l am also proud to claim them, 
of course, as my children. 
Page 7/34
This is all wrong. To our Spy Kids. To our Spy Kids. To our Spy Kids. To our Spy Kids. To our Spy Kids. This ugh........ 
Secure the perimeter. 
Sleepers. 
They're after the Transmooker device. Take them down. 
- Pull. 
- Pull. 
- Get off, squirt. 
- Ugh. 
Give me that back. 
- You all right, sir? 
- Yeah. 
Come here. Juni, get off of him. 
No, no. They took the Transmooker device. They took the Transmooker device. The following Spy Kid cadets 
please report to the psychic abilities seminar Mike Cardenas and Daniel Duluth. lt's my turn, too. Are you sure? 
All right, your last name is? 
Hold on a second. l had the Transmooker in my hand, but you know Juni..... he wanted to claim it for himself. Okay, that should do it. Thank you, son. Right. lf that Transmooker device falls into the wrong hands, we're doomed. 
Thank you, Mr. President. That will be all. We're doomed. Understood, sir. 
Here. 
"Floop's Fooglie" 
Starring Minion and Carmenita....... Thanks. 
l was fired. l know. l hacked into the O.S.S. data files and saw the news. lt was probably my fault, l suppose. l am sorry. Well, l guess that's that. Let's go to the tree house. l got an idea. l guess l could always set up a small detective agency out here or something. You're thinking small again, Juni. The old tree house needs another helicopter pad. 
Page 8/34
lt needs a paint job, is what it needs. Your name? Carmen Elizabeth Juanita Echo Sky Brava Cortez. 
Your name? 
Juni Rocket Racer Rebelde Cortez. 
You know... l am kind of looking 
forward to retirement, 
get back to all the projects and dreams l left behind. Oh, stop it, Juni. 
Look, do you want your job back or not? That's right... reinstated Level 2. So now we can get back the 
missing Transmooker. How? 
Looks like Gary and Gerti are about to get briefed on the Ukata assignment. We should listen in. 
ls R.A.L.P.H. still at your office? lf they haven't cleaned it out yet. R.A.L.P.H., get to the briefing room. We need you to spy on Gary and Gerti. Make sure no one sees you. 
There is a Bermuda Triangle of sorts off the coast of Madagascar. 
As you may remember, this is an area where some of our O.S.S. cargo ships have been disappearing. Good boy, R.A.L.P.H. The survivors of these disappearances tell delusional tales of a..... 
mysterious island 
populated by strange creatures. 
Obviously, no land mass is 
located anywhere near there, so... these tales were dismissed, 
and the agents fired. However..... the magnet ship that captured the Transmooker device was last seen in this same area. So, we need a small ship, piloted by two small agents to go in and take a closer look. lf you find anything out of the ordinary, you return, you report it back here. - We accept. We accept. 
- You bet we accept. 
Come home, R.A.L.P.H. Good work. 
lt's a great assignment, but Gary 
Page 9/34
and Gerti have it, and l am fired. 
And l am reassigning you to the O.S.S. Don't tell me you're hacking into... Already done. Level 2 status reinstated. 
Carmen, you can't do this. 
l already did it. 
l'd take it one step further. 
We're assigning ourselves 
to the Ukata assignment. 
l am programming a new destination for Gary and Gerti. Now, that, l got to be a part of. State your name, please. Gary Giggles. Access denied. lt knows you're not him. Confirmed. 
New destination? How about..... 
Gobi Desert? Stop it, Juni. 
What? Don't want your boyfriend to go so far away? He's not my boyfriend. Okay, then. Destination confirmed. 
There. What did we just do again? 
We're going to get the Transmooker 
device back so we can clear your name. We just have to solve the case before anybody finds out what we're up to. Are you with me? OK. Then let's go. 
"Hello?" 
Hello? Hey, what are you doing up there? Sorry, we thought you were somebody else. Who gave you a key? 
Did you forget who built you this place? Come down from there. 
l brought you all-new gadgets. 
Check it out. The very latest spy 
watch, total communication center, 
right there on your wrist. Cellphone, lnternet access, satellite TV... you name it. 
That baby will do everything but tell you what time it is. lt doesn't tell time? 
No, there was so much stuffed into it, there was no more room for the clock. Cool. Are you sure these are new? We can't be running around with outdated equipment. Close your eyes and hold out your wrist. l am going to give you the one gadget you 
Page 10/34

should always carry. A rubber band? No. It's a Machete elastic wonder. 
lt's a rubber band. 
Yeah, but it's also the world's greatest gadget 999 uses, and the important thing is you have to figure out what 
those uses are... with this. He's right. Use number one... A stylish bracelet. Use number two... Ahh. 
l am going to make a fortune with these. Are you sure this is going to work? Just be cool. 
As far as anybody knows, you're back on the force. Hey, Uncle Felix. Oh. 
l am not your uncle. l know. lt's just easier to call you that. Um, you don't mind, do you? Of course not. 
Well, welcome back, Juni. Says here you were reinstated. Sure does, doesn't it? He was fired and rehired all in the same day. Okay. 
Let me bring up the keys 
to the Dragon Spy Five. 
- Cake. 
- Six o'clock. 
Wow. You're looking good 
with the new gear, Carmen. 
Their latest stuff. Very cool... 
only we had that weeks ago. 
Here's what's really new. 
Nanotechnology...... 
everything you're wearing 
is right here on my wrist. 
lt's superaccurate and, oh, so light. lt even tells time. How did you get that? Well, it's all prototype, Juni. 
You can't be running around 
with those mass-produced gadgets. 
Just means everyone's got them. 
l always go with the prototype. 
Sure, they're a little buggy, 
But l can deal. 
l.... l accidentally squashed him 
on my way out of the O.S.S. building. Uh. Page 11/34

Sorry about that. He was outdated, anyway, so think of it as a mercy killing. 
Gary and Gerti Giggles, you have 
assignment SElKJU9. Good luck. 
Don't hurt yourselves with that outdated gear. Remember, an agent is only as good as his gadgets. What? You have the Ukata assignment? 
Very nice. You will love it. 
Thanks, Uncle Felix. 
l am not your uncle. 
Oh, nice sub. 
Welcome to the Dragon Spy DLX. 
Seems like they get more and more sophisticated each month. Everything is automated. 
Now picking your nose. 
Little brothers. 
Let's check our lunchboxes 
for mission updates. 
Sorry, R.A.L.P.H. You were the best spy on the force. Juni, leave it alone. He's dead. Thanks to your buddy Gary. lt was an 
accident. You like him and believe him? l don't like him...... that much. 
Gary's a bad guy, Carmen. Maybe l know that. l think l can change him. 
l do not understand you. And you never will. French fry, sir? Uh. Uh. Ow. 
Give me that. 
Strange... tales of a mysterious island, disappearing ships, mysterious creatures, and yet, no information anywhere 
on the O.S.S. cargo or the magnet ship. What's Donnagon doing there? 
He wasn't O.S.S. director yet. 
These are old O.S.S. secrets. And l know just the person we can call for advice. Who? 
# Who # 
# Who # 
# What, when # 
# Where # 
# What, when # 
# Where # 
# Who, what, when # 
Page 12/34
# Where and why # 
# l delight in what... # 
# Do l intend to find, find # 
# This time # 
# Run around, jumping down # 
# Bounce and bound and... # 
# Find another way to duck and hide # # This isle of... # 
# Dreams # 
- Hello? Yes. 
- One moment, please. 
Cut. 
Cut. 
Who is it again? 
Juni Cortez. What can l do for you? l mean, you have done so much for me. Your robot counterparts are the surprise hit characters of my show. Say hello. 
# Hello # 
# Hello # 
Actually, Carmen wants a word with 
Mr. Minion. Oh. He is right here. 
- Minion is practicing a 4-part harmony. - You have one minute. 
Bueno? How you doing, Minion? 
Things are a little Floopy around here for my taste, but it's a living. 
l need some information on your favorite subject the O.S.S. l need to make a call. Okay, you ready? Ukata... 
Transmooker.... The president's daughter is unavailable. Manage. Press "1" to record. Mean anything to you? 
Smells like the work of Donnagon Giggles. He had first contact with 
the Transmooker technology. 
You think Donnagon's the one behind all this? You're talking to a man with four heads. Trust me... the guy is dirt. What should we look for? First, find the island. Then find the lsland Man. That would have been Donnagon's contact. Okay. Thanks, Minion. Be a good girl and swat your brother for me. Oh, l will. 
Page 13/34

Something's wrong. Take the wheel. Got to go. Good luck. 
Slow down. We're nearing destination zone. The radius where all the 
disappearances occurred is right... .....here. 
We have been shut down. 
Hold onto something. 
All power is off..... 
even the emergency power. 
My flashlight doesn't even work. 
We're stuck, aren't we? 
Let's get out of here. 
- Rebreathers. Rebreathers. 
- You got to do it by hand. What next? - Nope. 
- Hand, Carmen. 
- Unbelievable. 
- "Low-tech." 
Here we go. 
Should we travel light or heavy? We may not be coming back down here. Let's go heavy. - Inflate-a-suits? 
- We don't have much choice. 
At least the "masks" work. 
l think it's because they're 
valve-operated, not electrical-based. - lt's so strange. Good luck. 
- You too. Stay close. 
- Oh, great. l am fat. 
- Was it supposed to do this? 
lt has an electrical automatic 
shut-off which didn't work. 
Luckily, we ran out of air before the suits exploded. Well, we can still laugh. At what? At whatever you can imagine Gary and Gerti are doing right about now. Gerti, where are we? Well, according to my coordinates, we are... l think that.... Camel poop. 
Someone's going to pay. Cortezes...... l like your new office. lt's smaller..... cozy. Especially smaller. 
- Oh. So many successful missions. Page 14/34
- Amazing, isn't it? Remember this one? Oh. - Which mission is that? Mexico. 
- Of course. 
Hmm. Actually, that was the one mission we never accomplished. lngrid..... don't start with your parents again. lt's funny you should mention them. No. When l mention your parents, 
it is the exact opposite of funny. Doesn't it bother you that we 
never got their full blessing? 
Frankly, you deserve another chance to show them. All right, all right. 
lnvite them if you want, 
but l won't be here. 
Tell them that l had a... 
l had to go on another mission, 
that... that we're having a little problem on the moon. My father loves the moon. You invited them already, didn't you? Mmm... define "invite." Cortezes. 
What? l have some bad news. 
May l come in? 
Certainly, sir. Yes, sir. Great. 
Here "he" is. 
Two of our Spy Kid operatives 
are lost on the Ukata assignment. 
Your children had that assignment. l am so sorry, Donnagon. How can we help? Actually, my children are safe 
somewhere in the Gobi Desert, l believe. I am sorry to say that Carmen and Juni are somehow the ones on the Ukata assignment.... a computing error of some kind. 
Communications? None. 
Their Dragon Spy ship doesn't show up on radar or satellite. Greg, lngrid, you guys risked your lives 
once before to save me. 
Let me go now and personally bring your children back. No. Thank you. 
Thank you, Donnagon, but, respectfully, we have to do this ourselves. 
lf you could provide tactical back-up Page 15/34

and surveillance support of our efforts, we will leave immediately. Okay, yeah. Uh, lngrid... l know this may be 
a bad time, but, um..... 
Your parents are here. 
But you guys told me you 
were coming next Tuesday. 
This is a very dangerous assignment, and you have to wait here. Well, we want to help. Don't worry. You taught me everything l know. Yes..... 
but not everything we know. Of course not, Dad. See you in a few hours. Thanks, honey. l still don't like him. 
Juni...... was that there before? 
That wasn't there a minute ago, was it? Are you kicking me? l am way over here. l felt something against my foot. There's something under me. Come look. Uhh. l don't see anything, Juni. Let's just concentrate on getting to shore. 
Okay, it's about 200 yards. 
lf we kick steadily at one foot per kick, we will reach it in, um... 25 minutes? l don't know. 
My calculator doesn't work. 
Whoa. Whoa. Juni, what did you do? 
The air's coming out of our suits. 
We're heading towards shore. 
"Travel heavy." 
- Good idea. All right. 
- Give it a rest. Ugh. Ugh. 
Okay, we're going to set up a campsite, put up the tent, build a little fire. And roast marshmallows? 
l can't believe this. What happened? Nothing that's just it. 
That was supposed to make an instant campfire, and that was supposed to make a shelter. None of our gadgets work. You mean 
we have to use our heads? Yes. Ouch. Big office...... 
Director of the O.S.S.'s office. Big. Did you find the source 
Page 16/34
of equal or greater power? 
lt emanates from the north side of the island. Have you located the lsland Man? He's somewhere underground. Yeah, well, start digging. l am on my way. 
Come on, Juni. Let's go check out the island. l just set up camp. See? 
Sure wish Gary was here. He'd want 
to find out who was behind all this. - Aw, man. 
- All right, let's go. 
Wow. This place is amazing. 
Check out that rock. 
Looks like a hot dog. Uh-huh. Well, l have seen enough. Let's go back to the beach. - What? Listen. 
- l hear something humming. 
Somebody here has power. 
We need to find out who and for what. Destination Ukata. Estimated time of arrival one minute and counting. 
How fast are we going? 
- 85 knots. Well... go faster. 
- With pleasure. 
Faster. 
Faster. 
- Faster. Can't go faster. Faster. 
- l broke the fast thingy. 
Faster. 
Faster. 
All right..... now what? 
This is terrific. You know, this is just great. You really did it this time, Gerti. Are you kicking me? 
No. l am way over here, cheese ball. l am going to zap that sucker to bits. Come here. 
Wait. 
Save it for the Cortezes. Yeah. Excellent idea. l don't get it. I saw it go through this wall. What's your assessment, Juni? 
l'd think better with food in my belly. l think we should go up there and check it out. Up there... To the top of the volcano? 
Page 17/34
Yep. Not even if my micrograpplers were working. Gary would be brave enough to do it. Nope. Nothing you can say can change my mind. What did you just say? l didn't. 
Race you to the top. 
"Volcano." 
Juni, stay back. 
lt's not active. 
Juni. 
- What are you waiting for? 
- Get me out of here. 
lf my auto retractor was working, 
l'd get us both back up there. 
Okay. l am going to grab your hand. 
Okay. 
- My cellphone. Ugh. Why'd you stop? 
- Something wrong? Close your eyes. Why? - Juni. What? 
- l am sorry. 
How long have we been falling? 
l don't know. My watch doesn't tell time. Best guess? l'd say about three hours. Feels like four. 
How could you be eating 
at a time like this? 
You know that tickling sensation you 
get when you fall? Of course. 
That pretty much went 
away after the first hour. 
What happened? 
l don't know. We're floating. 
Who are you? Do you see something? 
Over there, hiding. What do you want? l want to get down. l am Carmen Cortez, special agent of the O.S.S. 
l am Romero, sole inhabitant of this 
island of Leeke Leeke...... 
...sole human inhabitant, that is. 
And you are? Tired and hungry. 
Nice to meet you, Tired and Hungry. 
Careful. 
You will crush my island. Sorry. 
We just fell four hours. 
We're a little clumsy right now. 
Page 18/34
You weren't falling. 
lt was an illusion. 
Magic? 
Science. 
Quickly, we must get somewhere safe. l am a genetic specialist. l needed a controlled environment for my experiments. The creatures we have been hearing? My experiments..... run amok. What happened? l thought l would 
make a fortune from it. 
Kids everywhere would have their own miniature zoos, right there in their bedrooms. A miniature zoo? God's creatures... on a manageable scale. 
Unbelievable. l called it "Romero's Zoo" genetically miniaturized animals. 
Lions, tigers, bears, penguins..... Monkeys. 
Monkeys in a barrel. Be careful. 
Careful. 
One day, l accidentally mixed up 
two or three different test tubes 
and created a new species.... altogether. Romero's Zoo Too.... 
an entirely new..... miniature zoo.... where each species is unlike any 
creature you have ever seen. Horse-fly? Cat-fish. 
Spider-monkey? 
Bull-frog. 
Uh... slizzards. 
Whoa. Stay away from those. 
And so, l started to think, "lf only l could make them all a wee bit bigger," You know, for kids with meatier hands. That's where things went very wrong. l applied a growth serum, 
and they took to it all too well. 
No. And l have been locked 
up in here ever since. 
l am afraid to go out there again. 
They have tried to gobble me up on more than one occasion. Why do they despise me so? 
Page 19/34
l created them. 
Do you think... God stays in Heaven because he, too, lives in fear of what he is created.... ....here on Earth? Stop looking at me 
like that. l am no loon. 
What l am still trying to figure out 
is why this island doesn't show up 
on even our most advanced satellites. 
l created a cloaking device to 
shield my island from curious eyes. 
Anything electronically powered that comes within a mile radius instantly shuts down. Any radar that passes over me is displaced, creating the illusion that my island 
doesn't exist. The Transmooker device. 
How did you know? 
Your cloaking device is highly coveted. People everywhere are trying 
to get their hands on it. 
Are you sure we're the only humans here? There they are... two children, 
judging by their size. What is this? 
It's a miniature of the island. 
The center point of the volcano 
provides a gravitational basis.... 
for which my miniature creatures can line up exactly to their larger clone counterparts. So, wherever your miniature creatures are on this model, it's where the bigger ones are outside? Correct. l can keep track of 
their whereabouts this way. See? 
The two intruder children are being chased by a slizzard. Gary and Gerti. Leave them. We have to go help them. They shouldn't be snooping around my island to begin with. 
l am with you, dude. We have to help them. l am not going out there. l will be eaten. - What a bizarre man. Help us. Help. 
- Help us. Help. Somebody. 
What are you guys doing down there? 
That's real funny, clown. Get us out. 
We tried to activate our micrograpplers, but they didn't deploy. Nothing works here. Yeah, we know that now. 
Page 20/34
Thanks for the update, carrot top. 
Juni, come back. They need our help. Oh, l will help them. 
l want to get him back over here so l can push him back over myself. Hurry up. Come on. Here, Gary. Give me your hand. 
Thank you, Carmen. 
Here, Gerti... give me your hand. Just wait till my father gets here. Your father's coming? Where are you taking me now, Carmen? Hold on. 
Why are you still hiding? We're kids, not monsters. What's the difference? Relax. They're O.S.S. agents, as well. Level one. They're Donnagon's kids. 
Agent Donnagon? You work for the O.S.S., don't you? l work for a man named Donnagon. Who is this guy? Donnagon's not 
interested in your creatures. Why not? The Transmooker device that hides your island that's what Donnagon really wants. That's not nearly as interesting. 
Now that Donnagon's head of the O.S.S., he has the power to take it from you. What are you babbling about now, Juni? The Transmooker you took from the president's daughter, Gary. lt was just a prototype. The real Transmooker device is here on this island. It's even more powerful.... and can shut down all technology on the planet. You said your father's on his way. l think he's coming to pick it up. 
You're all liars. Do you really think you're going to turn us on our own father? Did your dad tell you the mission you went on was just a set-up for Carmen and me? Why not? He has his reasons. That's what being a good spy is all about trust no one. How to Be a Spy, we have read it. 
Well, read it again. 
A good spy makes no binding 
connections with family or friends. 
Well, l don't believe in that, do you? lf you want to be a good spy, you better believe it. 
Page 21/34

My father's a great spy, so let's grow up, shall we? Whatever my father's done, 
it's what it takes to play in the big world like it or not. Come on, Gerti. Let's go. He is right. Oh. Why can't you 
side with me just once? 
There are no sides. You're right, and he is right, too. That's what being a spy means. Well, l don't like it. Then quit. 
l will. Yeah, right. 
Donnagon was right. Their Dragon Spy 
doesn't show up anywhere on radar. 
l am not interested in finding the sub. Remember that year l insisted on doing the children's dental work... myself? 
How could l forget? Well... l installed a nonelectrical tracking device in their teeth... my own invention. But l haven't been 
able to test it, until... now. 
Honey, it works. Whoa... Hard to believe. But according to this... 
They're in the middle of the ocean. 
Above sea level. 
But where they are on the map, 
there's no land mass. How can that be? "Now what?" 
Something's got us. 
Aaah. What is it? Your mother. Mom? 
We wanted to join you. Are you nuts? 
We needed a bigger boat. 
And we brought real food..... 
none of that freeze-dried stuff you think's so chic. Son-in-law. Yeah? Make yourself useful. Why are you here? We wanted to help get our grandchildren back. Ah-ah. 
We will get our grandchildren back. Gracias. Oh, wait. You have got something on your lip. What? Got it. Uh, Mom, Dad, l am a big girl now, and l can take care of myself, okay? 
And Gregorio and l, we can take care of finding our children. No, you don't seem to understand. This isn't you and Gregorio 
simply saving the world again. 
This time, we all have much more to lose Page 22/34

if you fail, Carmen and Juni. 
You cannot come with us. 
lt is too dangerous. 
Oh, you mean, uh, 
we can't handle ourselves, huh? 
May l have my moustache back, please? lf Donnagon really is on his way 
we have to destroy the Transmooker. Where is it? 
The other side of the island. 
Not easy to get to. 
The journey alone is more dangerous than the Transmooker itself. l made sure of it. Show us. You're not going out there, are you? We don't have much choice, do we? 
With those monsters running around? l don't believe they're monsters. 
Maybe you shouldn't, either. 
Well, what should l believe? l don't know. You're always in here hiding. Maybe they just want to be with you. Be with me? They want to be picking me out of 
their teeth, is what they want to be. You just got to show them who's boss. You're not afraid? 
First thing you got to do is.... 
......fall into this pit. 
How does it work? 
Supposedly, they run magnetically. We should be able to ride 
over a determined path. 
We have to get the 
Transmooker before they do. Right. - Slizzards. 
- Oh, no. 
This is cool. 
- Juni. 
- Juni. 
- I think we should get off now. 
- Why? Trust me. 
- Aaah. 
- Jump now. 
Gary and Gerti. l told you they 
were following us. Uh. 
Page 23/34
You have one new message. Message one. Hello, Alexandra, it's me agent Juni Cortez. l am on a mission. l know l shouldn't be. But l had an idea for you and your father. Simply tell him you need to talk to him. Tell him it's nothing urgent, 
but someday it might be urgent. 
And you need to open the 
communication lines right now. 
So give me a call. Love to hear from you. And right now it's about... 
Silly me, l forgot my watch doesn't tell time. Heh. And, uh..... 
Something's wrong. Take the wheel. 
Got to go. Good luck. Juni. End of message. Gregorio, the signal requires that you go around it. He won't listen to you. He won't listen to you, Mother. 
Choose another direction..... 
He wants to make sure 
he loses the children again. 
lf you would only listen to us and do what we're saying you're tracking them all wrong. lngrid, tell him he's tracking them all wrong. Mom, Dad, l have told you before, and l will tell you again, 
No backseat driving. 
Thank you. When Gregorio is at the wheel, no one tells him what to do. 
Turn here, honey. 
Sorry. Okay. You're sure 
you're reading that map correctly? 
The coordinates correspond to Carmen and Juni's current position. These are my children. And l will find them my way. 
Blah, blah, blah. l never understand a single word he's saying. Never. 
Not only were we set up, 
but l bet Donnagon knew all along 
that you'd hack your way into taking this assignment. l was wondering the same thing. Juni, open up. What? Aah. Aah. Dad installed these trackers in case we ever got lost. Hurry. Take mine out. 
Page 24/34
And why are we doing this? 
When we get lost, who saves us? Mom and Dad. Now, if Mom and Dad also disappear.... who's going to stop Donnagon from 
using the Transmooker device? 
Donnagon wants us all together so he can destroy the island and all of us with it. Mom and Dad, even Romero. We can't let Mom and Dad find us or Donnagon wins. - A big sacrifice. 
- Family is sacrifice. 
What happened? 
What did... what did you just do? 
We lost Carmen. 
And... and Juni? Juni's still on-line. l love you. 
That can't be. 
Okay, okay. What do we do? 
l don't know. 
Maybe this is like the mission of 
the spies who didn't want to be found. You know if they don't want to be found, maybe their position is compromised. Now, Gregorio, don't tell me 
you didn't have a back-up plan. 
lngrid, was Juni wearing that charm necklace l sent him for Christmas last year? He never takes it off. Then we got him. l was worried about Juni's well-being, so l put a tracer in his necklace. There he is. Thanks, Dad. Are you sure you don't want me to take over the wheel? That's funny. lt's funny. 
Back to work. Where are we? 
Well.... not far from the antechamber. l think it's behind us. 
Don't move. Maybe it's friendly. 
Maybe it's not. 
Let's go. 
lt's an underwater cave. We will have to go all the way around. That will take all day. There must be a faster..... 
- Wow... 
- What is this place? 
Page 25/34
- Do you think that's real gold? 
- Gross. This is so slimy. 
- l hate mold. l can hear your thoughts. - What? And you can hear mine. 
Our mouths aren't moving, but we can hear what we're thinking. Say something. How strange. We can only communicate by thought. Magic. Hmm. Think something. Um... your feet stink. 
l wonder. 
- Ohhh. Oh. Oh. Okay. 
- This place is really weird. Let's go. Good thinking. 
- Now, this is more like it. 
- Treasure. 
- Skeletons. Dead skeletons. 
- ls there any other kind? 
This must have been where the pirate prisoners and treasure were kept. 
This must have been a pretty special necklace for them to die fighting over it. One necklace to rule them all. 
Put it back, Juni. l didn't take it yet. l can read your mind, remember? 
This land is ancient and cursed. 
lf you take anything, 
you will doom us both. Let's go. 
Come on. l think l found a way out. Which way? l don't know, you pick, right or left? Right. - Wait a minute. Oh, no. 
- We went in a circle. What? 
- Come on. 
- Let's try it again. 
Come on, Juni. l know what we did wrong. We have got to go left. 
Maybe l should put this back. 
Uh-oh. Where are the dead skeletons? - Aaaah. 
- Carmen. 
Juni. 
Juni. 
- Help me. 
- Huh? 
Hey, "bonehead." 
Page 26/34
Oh, no. 
- Why is this happening? 
- l don't know. 
Wait a minute. You took something, didn't you? No. You told me not to. Why would l? 
- Oh. 
- Juni. Carmen. 
- Oh. 
- Juni. Carmen. 
- Wait. 
- Ah. 
l am sorry. 
- Carmen. 
- Carmen. 
- You too, huh? 
- Yeah. 
Where's your brother? 
Did he get eaten? 
No. He's out there looking for Juni. You know he squashed Juni's bug on purpose. Yeah, l know. Now he wants to squash Juni. Don't you think we 
should get out of here? 
- Oh. 
- Mm-hmm. 
- Carmen. l am dreaming. 
- l am totally dreaming. 
And l am hungry, too. 
- Oh. Oh. 
- Oh. 
You like honey-roasted ham and potatoes, don't you? That's what flavor this is. Highly nutritious. Packed with protein and essential carbs. Hyah. 
Everything a growing centaur needs. You're welcome. 
Well, well, well. Your friend 
likes freeze-dried. So does mine. 
All right, buddy. 
Let's kick their butts. 
Heh heh heh. We're waiting. Come on. Can't let you bust up my dad's machine, Juni. Whoa. So l guess l will just have to bust 
Page 27/34
you up. We can take them. 
Come on, buddy. We can take them. 
l don't think we can take them. 
Must try and help them. 
Must. So, even if your dad is behind all this, you'd still side with him over what's right? Right? How do you ever know what's right? Trust me, when the moment comes, you will know. l think that moment's come. 
- Come on. Show them who's boss. 
- Show them who's boss. l am the boss. l am the...... 
Oh. 
Oh. 
Look out. 
Forward, go, man. 
- Come on, spidey. 
- You can do it. Yeah. 
Your creature's lame. So are you, 
lame-o. lt's all over for you, squirt. Too bad your dork sister's 
not here to cheer me on. 
Hey. 
Hey. 
l don't want to hurt you, Carmen. 
You're so full of shiitake mushrooms. Put it down, Carmen. 
Put it down. 
- Okay. All right. 
- Gerti, a little assistance here. 
Don't look at me, brother. You are fighting a girl. You're going to lose. 
l am siding with you. Thanks. 
But just this once. 
Cortezes. 
You going to help me or not? 
Well, there it is. How do you know? 
Because it's big and weird and in 
the middle of the room. Good point. 
Careful, Juni. 
lf you don't shut it down right.... 
you can bring the entire world to an end. Thanks. l am serious. Well, we have to shut it down. This turns that off. 
Page 28/34

And that turns this off. 
He said there's something 
tricky about the third switch. 
Let's see. 
Too late, Gary. We got here first. Just stand up against the wall 
like a good boy and leave us alone. Nice try, but we 
brought friends this time. 
Romero. What are you doing outside of your cage? l have no idea. 
- Donnagon. Hello, agents. 
- Warming it up for me? 
Are you ready to cooperate this time, Romero? l, uh... Good. 
This should be pain... and simple. Oh. What did you do? He started the Transmooker. You said three switches. The entire world will shut down instantly. Good going, cheese ball. What do we do? You must bind together 
the three toggle switches. 
lt won't stay up. Machete elastic wonder. Machete elastic wonder. Here grab it. Oh. - Give it to me. Give it. Dad... 
- Give it to me. 
Give it to me... 
...or else. Give it to him, Carmen. Where'd it go? Where'd it go? l don't know. The spork took it. Back to its nest. No. l know where the nest is, Dad. l also have Romero's instruction book. Hey. Brat. Come on. 
lt's just over that big hill. Ohh. Ohh. Are you sure this is the right way? My watch has a GPS satellite, you dope. Wait a minute. How can this be? 
When you took out the Transmooker, the island cloaking device was shut down. Then what are we doing on foot? 
Later, Romero. 
There it is. 
Get up there, Dad. Come on. 
Okay, Magna Men, we're going to need a human Page 29/34
ladder starting right here. Carmen. 
What? 
An agent's only as good as her gadgets. They're heading for the beach. 
Help. 
Help. 
The kid was right. 
What are you doing? 
Trying to remote-pilot our submarine to the surface so we can get out of here. Get on your GPS and see 
where Mom and Dad are. 
This can't be right. This shows that they are right next to us. 
Oh, no. That's no way to greet 
your grandparents. Come on. Grandpa. - Ah, Juni. 
- Come here, come here. 
Always take this with you wherever you go, and l will always be there. l promise, Grandpa. Not you guys. Oh. You don't want to be rescued. You don't want to be saved. That's all right. We thought you might... you might need us. Go talk to your father. Dad. Hey, Mom. Come on, Dad. Look at me. Two spies who didn't want to be found? Yes. Yes. l like your thinking. 
But you know what? Those spies didn't have me for a mom. Come on. Thank you. Hey. l will always need you. 
- Come on. Carmen Elizabeth Juanita..... - Come here to your papa. You okay, hon? All right. lnformation. Quick. 
Okay, we have the Transmooker device, but we need to get off this island right now. What do you think we're here for? Let's go. We will explain it on the way. 
You won't believe who's behind this. lt couldn't be any more perfect. 
This better not be what l think it is. lt's all being taken care of, all right? Get the Transmooker device, Felix. Felix? Sorry, Gregorio. 
A little power goes a long way, doesn't it? Page 30/34

Reprogram this one, Gerti. 
l want to start by wiping the Cortez family from the face of the Earth. Uncle Felix, how could you? l am not your uncle. But we treated you like family. Donnagon said if l joined him, he... ....he wouldn't get rid of me 
like he's going to do to you guys. You can't argue with that. Do you still have power in your watch? Yep. Programming complete, Father. Thank you, Gerti. Try remote-piloting the choppers. Well, Cortezes, any last words? None that l can say in front of my children. Not to mention your mother. 
Let's settle this the old-fashioned way. Aah. Kick his butt. Yeah, kick his butt. - Not like that. 
- "Headbutt." 
Sleeper hold. 
Use his own weight against him. Yeah. - Ah, get up. 
- Do what l showed you last night. Suplex. 
- Even l can fight better than that. - Mom. Triple backflip. 
- Gerti? What did you...? Why? 
- Oh, don't even get me started. 
Just wait till Mom finds out you tried to take over the world again. 
No. Please, please, please. 
D... Don't tell your mother. Please? Uh, hello. Hello, there, Mr. President. By order of the president, 
you have been temporarily disavowed. You're fired. Uh. Looks like l lost this round, but l will be back. 
Hopefully, you're on the good side next time. We will see, but... 
...you never know. Don't worry. He gets out of line, l will straighten him out. You go, Gerti. 
You tried to save us. Why? 
Because you are my family. 
Page 31/34

You know... there isn't a man on this Earth we'd ever think would be good enough for our daughter, but, um... you come pretty close. By order of the president, you are the new director of the O.S.S. Congratulations. Do they..... are they..... 
Level one. 
- No, thanks. You don't want it? 
- l am leaving the O.S.S. 
l have seen what it takes to be a top spy, and l think l can be better use to the world by just being the best... me. 
But what about all the cool gadgets? l got the best gadget right here. Use number one, a stylish bracelet. See you around? Yes. - Go ahead. Say it. What? 
- l told you so. 
Never. 
Never. 
Wait. 
Uh....... 
Thank you. You got it, boss. 
Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. 
Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. 
Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. 
Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. 
l am not going out there. 
Oh, yes, you are. 
You're a spy, you're undercover, and you have to make them think you're a pop star. l can't sing. Who can these days? 
l can't tell you how many artists have used my Machete miracle microphone. # l can't sing # 
This will make you dance like Britney Lopez. Hey, what about me? 
This will make you play like Angus Van Santana. Cool. Now get out there and rock. # Who, what, when, where, and why # # Do l delight in #

Back to one. 
Ready. Yeah, but..... 
Guys, guys, we're looking 
at light on her face. Oops. 
My precious. We're nearing the 
destination zone, where all..... 
No. And then the next sentence is "The location radius where all the disappearances." Okay. We're nearing destination zone. The location 
Page 33/34
radius where all the disappearances..... Stop. Okay. We're nearing destination zone, where all the disappearances..... - Stop. l know it. l don't know it. - Juni, take wheel. What is...... What is it? 
What is it? 
Okay, what is it? 
Okay. 
Well, well, well, well, whoo. 
Man, you're not an easy man to find, you and your island of Leeke Leeke. l am Dinky. Winks, that is. Heard you had a wild place here, and, uh, well, sir, l was thinking you might be interested in a little, uh, business proposition. - You ready? Theme park. 
- Think about it. 
Families on safari, crazy critters running all over the place. 
- Hey, there, fella. Uhh. 
- Whoa. 
You can see it already, can't you? Huh? We'd be great together. What do you say?

Page 1/34
Hello, everyone. 
We want to welcome a very special guest to our park today the president's daughter. Big smile. Big smile. Hello, Alexandra. Where's your father? He will be here. l will make sure of it. 
Well, hey there, little miss first lady, l am Dinky Winks, owner of 
this fine establishment. 
You ready to ride the ride and shrill to the thrills, spills, and chills? 
Yes, l am. Right this way. 
Of course, that behind me..... 
The world famous Whippersnapper. 
Guaranteed to make grown men howl 
like a cub woke at weaning time. 
Over on our left... Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. The NerveWracker.... oh-ho, painful. Good fun. On your other left is, uh, well, my personal favorite..... The Vomiter. Now, we tell people not to ride it on a full stomach, but you know folks. 
They just don't listen. 
But... why bother with any of those? You're here for my latest and greatest. For your personal amusement and complete gratification, l humbly offer.... the Juggler. But is it fast? ls it fast? 
Well, let's see, shall we? 
The riders are strapped into the bubble. The hydrobot lifts the 
bubble high into the air. 
And spins it round and round as fast as the United States government will allow. The bubble spins, turns, flips, and bounces. And then...... it juggles you. 
l want to go on. 
l thought so. 
Now, understand the override precautions are top-notch, modified by yours truly. 
l thought her father was supposed to be here. The president has more pressing business than to spend an entire Sunday in a theme park. No one's that busy. 
Page 2/34
Have fun, kid. 
We will take it a little slow, 
just make it fun. 
Mm-hmm. Can't you get her down? 
Somebody's jammed the override. 
Why, that little troublemaker. 
Remain calm. Remain calm. We are the Secret Service. Everything is under control. There's nothing we can do, sir. What? The weight of our agents 
will prevent us from ascending 
the shaky precipice on which she now stands. She will fall. Don't we have any smaller agents? Bring me agents SK1 and SK2. 
Coming through. Coming through. 
We're ready. Use this... the latest gear. We get to keep them afterwards? 
- N... No. Yes. 
- Of course. Let's rock. 
You're sure they can handle this? 
lf not, there are two others who can. Bring me agents SK3 and SK4 as back-up. Ugh. Ugh. We got company. 
Gary and Gerti... 
What are they doing here? Ugh. 
Excuse me there, sport. 
Where did you get that? 
Latest in electro-riser technology, with new composite materials and A.l. brainology. l can see you don't know what l am talking about. Gary, this is my rescue. 
We will take it from here. 
"Latest gear," my butt. 
No, no, no. You will just make it worse. Now you done it. Over here. Get away 
from me. Alexandra, take my hand. 
Back off. I want my father to 
come up here and get me. 
But he's the president of the United States. No, he's my father. 
He was my father before he ever became president, and he should still be my father now. l want him up here. Sir, we have a situation. She's got the Transmooker. 
Page 3/34
This is now a code-red situation. Get her down now. 
The point is, 
you and your father need to have a talk. Up here may not be the best place. Come with me, and l promise you, 
the two of you will have that talk. How can you promise that? l am Level 2. l can order him to talk to you. 
Hi, Gerti. What are you doing? 
l am trying to stop the ride. 
Without disengaging the axis? Exactly. Then stop what you're doing. 
You see, the ride is designed 
to work like a giant magnet. 
lf you reverse the polarization, 
bye-bye, president's daughter. 
See you around. 
Okay. Wait. l took this from my 
father's office this morning. 
l am sure he will want it back. 
Careful. Look, Cortez, you take her down, and l will take this down. 
That way, we both look good. 
l am not doing this for looks, Gary. Thank goodness you're all right, Alexandra. We were worried sick. Oh, boys. 
l think this is what you're looking for. She swiped it from the president. Oh, you're in big trouble this time, missy. Wait a minute. l promised her she could talk to her father. 
Oh, she will talk to him, all right. We will make sure of that. 
- Promise me one thing...... 
- What? 
no more winky-dinky assignments. 
So, you want the Ukata assignment, huh? Your duties are assigned to you by the agency same as everyone, same as me. l know. lt's just that 
we have learned so much. 
Juni and l are more than capable 
of taking bigger assignments. 
Page 4/34
But that's not your decision to make. 
The Spy Kids organization is still new, and if you're a Level 3 or even a Level 2, you cannot go on a mission alone. 
You need more experience. 
Come on. OK, Mom, if you're looking for top secret information, just go straight to the source. Welcome to the Pentagon. 
How did you do that? You can't do that. There is no hacking in this household. 
l know. Sorry. Show me that again. 
l know this hair thing is one of my weakest points. Wait one minute. You're going to look cool. ln fact, you're looking cooler, right? 
Like me. Like Poppy. 
And it's kind of em-o-tion-al to me. 
You know? Uh-oh. A knot. 
We are going to... 
You... Uh-huh, uh-huh. We got it. 
That's my boy. Last touch. 
Hup, hup. You want me to tie it for you? No, it's okay. R.A.L.P.H. can do it. 
Bow tie, R.A.L.P.H., and not too tight. Thanks, R.A.L.P.H. 
lnteresting. But... 
he can never, ever replace..... 
.....me. Pow. 
Not yet, but l think that new 
upgrade comes in next week. Uh-huh. 
- Oh. Only "joking." 
- Hey. 
- Kids. Kids. 
- Kids. Kids. 
"Joking"? 
Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Remember, kids, this is a very important night for your father. And if he's named director of the O.S.S., be sure to stand up and give him a big hug, all right? What if Dad doesn't win? 
Well, then, give him a bigger hug. 
Oh, Yao Ling, Wa Ling, this is Danielle and Dione Daluc. Hello. Hi. 
They created lnfolink, sort of an online trading system for swapping international secrets. 
Page 5/34
- Hi. Oh, hey. 
- Hello. Champagne? 
Can't have any of that. Sorry. 
Something doesn't feel right. 
No wonder your buddy's here. 
Your buddy with the weird laugh. 
He does not have a weird laugh. We were just... talking about you. Really? Wow. You look great, Carmen. 
You want to dance? Sure. 
l don't think that's a good idea, Gary. Family rules say you need to 
ask my father's permission. 
You know, you should have 
had that suit tailored, Juni. 
lt's bunching up around your gut, 
and it makes your head look way too big. You have to excuse my little brother. He's still a little upset 
about the... Juggler incident. 
A good agent controls his temper. 
Just be glad my dad isn't here. He gets really psycho about this sort of thing. Hi, Dad. Um, you remember Gary. 
He's in our organization. 
l was just asking your daughter for a dance. You know how to dance? Fairly well, sir. What kind of dances? All types of dances. What about tango? Yes. Mambo? Fairly well. Rumba? Yes. Cha-cha-cha? Seven steps. Bossa nova? Mm-hmm. Merengue? Of course. What about waltz? 
Y... Yeah, l can waltz. Show me. 
"Right." 
Something like that. 
All right. You can go to dance. 
Watch your older sister. 
Alexandra? Yes? 
What are you doing in there? Dancing. Do you always carry this 
many Secret Service around? 
My dad's idea.... 
he's gotten a little..... paranoid. Well, would you dance... with me? No. 
Page 6/34
All right, hold on a second, guys. 
Level 2.... break it up. 
Why not? 
l only dance... ballet. 
What an incredible coincidence. 
So do l. 
Well, Juni, l must say, 
you're a man of many talents. 
One tries. 
Uh, could you find your seats? 
We're ready to start. 
"I must go." 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
the president of the United States. Thank you. 
l am proud of the O.S.S. and their 
newly formed Spy Kids division. 
For their outstanding 
accomplishments yesterday. 
Gary and Gerti Giggles 
not only saved my daughter... 
What is he talking about? 
l saved her. Juni. But.... 
...more importantly, if not most importantly, they safely retrieved the Transmooker device that my daughter accidentally took from my office earlier that day. 
Now it is my great pleasure to announce the new director of the O.S.S.... 
.......Donnagon Giggles. 
Gary and Gerti Giggles are the kind of agents we need to turn the O.S.S. around. l am proud to award them 
these Level 1 badges, 
What? Which will enable them 
to take on real missions, 
something challenging, 
like the Ukata assignment. Yes. 
l wanted that assignment. 
This is so unfair. 
l am proud to claim them as our organization's top Spy Kid operatives. Something's not right. And l am also proud to claim them, 
of course, as my children. 
Page 7/34
This is all wrong. To our Spy Kids. To our Spy Kids. To our Spy Kids. To our Spy Kids. To our Spy Kids. This ugh........ 
Secure the perimeter. 
Sleepers. 
They're after the Transmooker device. Take them down. 
- Pull. 
- Pull. 
- Get off, squirt. 
- Ugh. 
Give me that back. 
- You all right, sir? 
- Yeah. 
Come here. Juni, get off of him. 
No, no. They took the Transmooker device. They took the Transmooker device. The following Spy Kid cadets 
please report to the psychic abilities seminar Mike Cardenas and Daniel Duluth. lt's my turn, too. Are you sure? 
All right, your last name is? 
Hold on a second. l had the Transmooker in my hand, but you know Juni..... he wanted to claim it for himself. Okay, that should do it. Thank you, son. Right. lf that Transmooker device falls into the wrong hands, we're doomed. 
Thank you, Mr. President. That will be all. We're doomed. Understood, sir. 
Here. 
"Floop's Fooglie" 
Starring Minion and Carmenita....... Thanks. 
l was fired. l know. l hacked into the O.S.S. data files and saw the news. lt was probably my fault, l suppose. l am sorry. Well, l guess that's that. Let's go to the tree house. l got an idea. l guess l could always set up a small detective agency out here or something. You're thinking small again, Juni. The old tree house needs another helicopter pad. 
Page 8/34
lt needs a paint job, is what it needs. Your name? Carmen Elizabeth Juanita Echo Sky Brava Cortez. 
Your name? 
Juni Rocket Racer Rebelde Cortez. 
You know... l am kind of looking 
forward to retirement, 
get back to all the projects and dreams l left behind. Oh, stop it, Juni. 
Look, do you want your job back or not? That's right... reinstated Level 2. So now we can get back the 
missing Transmooker. How? 
Looks like Gary and Gerti are about to get briefed on the Ukata assignment. We should listen in. 
ls R.A.L.P.H. still at your office? lf they haven't cleaned it out yet. R.A.L.P.H., get to the briefing room. We need you to spy on Gary and Gerti. Make sure no one sees you. 
There is a Bermuda Triangle of sorts off the coast of Madagascar. 
As you may remember, this is an area where some of our O.S.S. cargo ships have been disappearing. Good boy, R.A.L.P.H. The survivors of these disappearances tell delusional tales of a..... 
mysterious island 
populated by strange creatures. 
Obviously, no land mass is 
located anywhere near there, so... these tales were dismissed, 
and the agents fired. However..... the magnet ship that captured the Transmooker device was last seen in this same area. So, we need a small ship, piloted by two small agents to go in and take a closer look. lf you find anything out of the ordinary, you return, you report it back here. - We accept. We accept. 
- You bet we accept. 
Come home, R.A.L.P.H. Good work. 
lt's a great assignment, but Gary 
Page 9/34
and Gerti have it, and l am fired. 
And l am reassigning you to the O.S.S. Don't tell me you're hacking into... Already done. Level 2 status reinstated. 
Carmen, you can't do this. 
l already did it. 
l'd take it one step further. 
We're assigning ourselves 
to the Ukata assignment. 
l am programming a new destination for Gary and Gerti. Now, that, l got to be a part of. State your name, please. Gary Giggles. Access denied. lt knows you're not him. Confirmed. 
New destination? How about..... 
Gobi Desert? Stop it, Juni. 
What? Don't want your boyfriend to go so far away? He's not my boyfriend. Okay, then. Destination confirmed. 
There. What did we just do again? 
We're going to get the Transmooker 
device back so we can clear your name. We just have to solve the case before anybody finds out what we're up to. Are you with me? OK. Then let's go. 
"Hello?" 
Hello? Hey, what are you doing up there? Sorry, we thought you were somebody else. Who gave you a key? 
Did you forget who built you this place? Come down from there. 
l brought you all-new gadgets. 
Check it out. The very latest spy 
watch, total communication center, 
right there on your wrist. Cellphone, lnternet access, satellite TV... you name it. 
That baby will do everything but tell you what time it is. lt doesn't tell time? 
No, there was so much stuffed into it, there was no more room for the clock. Cool. Are you sure these are new? We can't be running around with outdated equipment. Close your eyes and hold out your wrist. l am going to give you the one gadget you 
Page 10/34

should always carry. A rubber band? No. It's a Machete elastic wonder. 
lt's a rubber band. 
Yeah, but it's also the world's greatest gadget 999 uses, and the important thing is you have to figure out what 
those uses are... with this. He's right. Use number one... A stylish bracelet. Use number two... Ahh. 
l am going to make a fortune with these. Are you sure this is going to work? Just be cool. 
As far as anybody knows, you're back on the force. Hey, Uncle Felix. Oh. 
l am not your uncle. l know. lt's just easier to call you that. Um, you don't mind, do you? Of course not. 
Well, welcome back, Juni. Says here you were reinstated. Sure does, doesn't it? He was fired and rehired all in the same day. Okay. 
Let me bring up the keys 
to the Dragon Spy Five. 
- Cake. 
- Six o'clock. 
Wow. You're looking good 
with the new gear, Carmen. 
Their latest stuff. Very cool... 
only we had that weeks ago. 
Here's what's really new. 
Nanotechnology...... 
everything you're wearing 
is right here on my wrist. 
lt's superaccurate and, oh, so light. lt even tells time. How did you get that? Well, it's all prototype, Juni. 
You can't be running around 
with those mass-produced gadgets. 
Just means everyone's got them. 
l always go with the prototype. 
Sure, they're a little buggy, 
But l can deal. 
l.... l accidentally squashed him 
on my way out of the O.S.S. building. Uh. Page 11/34

Sorry about that. He was outdated, anyway, so think of it as a mercy killing. 
Gary and Gerti Giggles, you have 
assignment SElKJU9. Good luck. 
Don't hurt yourselves with that outdated gear. Remember, an agent is only as good as his gadgets. What? You have the Ukata assignment? 
Very nice. You will love it. 
Thanks, Uncle Felix. 
l am not your uncle. 
Oh, nice sub. 
Welcome to the Dragon Spy DLX. 
Seems like they get more and more sophisticated each month. Everything is automated. 
Now picking your nose. 
Little brothers. 
Let's check our lunchboxes 
for mission updates. 
Sorry, R.A.L.P.H. You were the best spy on the force. Juni, leave it alone. He's dead. Thanks to your buddy Gary. lt was an 
accident. You like him and believe him? l don't like him...... that much. 
Gary's a bad guy, Carmen. Maybe l know that. l think l can change him. 
l do not understand you. And you never will. French fry, sir? Uh. Uh. Ow. 
Give me that. 
Strange... tales of a mysterious island, disappearing ships, mysterious creatures, and yet, no information anywhere 
on the O.S.S. cargo or the magnet ship. What's Donnagon doing there? 
He wasn't O.S.S. director yet. 
These are old O.S.S. secrets. And l know just the person we can call for advice. Who? 
# Who # 
# Who # 
# What, when # 
# Where # 
# What, when # 
# Where # 
# Who, what, when # 
Page 12/34
# Where and why # 
# l delight in what... # 
# Do l intend to find, find # 
# This time # 
# Run around, jumping down # 
# Bounce and bound and... # 
# Find another way to duck and hide # # This isle of... # 
# Dreams # 
- Hello? Yes. 
- One moment, please. 
Cut. 
Cut. 
Who is it again? 
Juni Cortez. What can l do for you? l mean, you have done so much for me. Your robot counterparts are the surprise hit characters of my show. Say hello. 
# Hello # 
# Hello # 
Actually, Carmen wants a word with 
Mr. Minion. Oh. He is right here. 
- Minion is practicing a 4-part harmony. - You have one minute. 
Bueno? How you doing, Minion? 
Things are a little Floopy around here for my taste, but it's a living. 
l need some information on your favorite subject the O.S.S. l need to make a call. Okay, you ready? Ukata... 
Transmooker.... The president's daughter is unavailable. Manage. Press "1" to record. Mean anything to you? 
Smells like the work of Donnagon Giggles. He had first contact with 
the Transmooker technology. 
You think Donnagon's the one behind all this? You're talking to a man with four heads. Trust me... the guy is dirt. What should we look for? First, find the island. Then find the lsland Man. That would have been Donnagon's contact. Okay. Thanks, Minion. Be a good girl and swat your brother for me. Oh, l will. 
Page 13/34

Something's wrong. Take the wheel. Got to go. Good luck. 
Slow down. We're nearing destination zone. The radius where all the 
disappearances occurred is right... .....here. 
We have been shut down. 
Hold onto something. 
All power is off..... 
even the emergency power. 
My flashlight doesn't even work. 
We're stuck, aren't we? 
Let's get out of here. 
- Rebreathers. Rebreathers. 
- You got to do it by hand. What next? - Nope. 
- Hand, Carmen. 
- Unbelievable. 
- "Low-tech." 
Here we go. 
Should we travel light or heavy? We may not be coming back down here. Let's go heavy. - Inflate-a-suits? 
- We don't have much choice. 
At least the "masks" work. 
l think it's because they're 
valve-operated, not electrical-based. - lt's so strange. Good luck. 
- You too. Stay close. 
- Oh, great. l am fat. 
- Was it supposed to do this? 
lt has an electrical automatic 
shut-off which didn't work. 
Luckily, we ran out of air before the suits exploded. Well, we can still laugh. At what? At whatever you can imagine Gary and Gerti are doing right about now. Gerti, where are we? Well, according to my coordinates, we are... l think that.... Camel poop. 
Someone's going to pay. Cortezes...... l like your new office. lt's smaller..... cozy. Especially smaller. 
- Oh. So many successful missions. Page 14/34
- Amazing, isn't it? Remember this one? Oh. - Which mission is that? Mexico. 
- Of course. 
Hmm. Actually, that was the one mission we never accomplished. lngrid..... don't start with your parents again. lt's funny you should mention them. No. When l mention your parents, 
it is the exact opposite of funny. Doesn't it bother you that we 
never got their full blessing? 
Frankly, you deserve another chance to show them. All right, all right. 
lnvite them if you want, 
but l won't be here. 
Tell them that l had a... 
l had to go on another mission, 
that... that we're having a little problem on the moon. My father loves the moon. You invited them already, didn't you? Mmm... define "invite." Cortezes. 
What? l have some bad news. 
May l come in? 
Certainly, sir. Yes, sir. Great. 
Here "he" is. 
Two of our Spy Kid operatives 
are lost on the Ukata assignment. 
Your children had that assignment. l am so sorry, Donnagon. How can we help? Actually, my children are safe 
somewhere in the Gobi Desert, l believe. I am sorry to say that Carmen and Juni are somehow the ones on the Ukata assignment.... a computing error of some kind. 
Communications? None. 
Their Dragon Spy ship doesn't show up on radar or satellite. Greg, lngrid, you guys risked your lives 
once before to save me. 
Let me go now and personally bring your children back. No. Thank you. 
Thank you, Donnagon, but, respectfully, we have to do this ourselves. 
lf you could provide tactical back-up Page 15/34

and surveillance support of our efforts, we will leave immediately. Okay, yeah. Uh, lngrid... l know this may be 
a bad time, but, um..... 
Your parents are here. 
But you guys told me you 
were coming next Tuesday. 
This is a very dangerous assignment, and you have to wait here. Well, we want to help. Don't worry. You taught me everything l know. Yes..... 
but not everything we know. Of course not, Dad. See you in a few hours. Thanks, honey. l still don't like him. 
Juni...... was that there before? 
That wasn't there a minute ago, was it? Are you kicking me? l am way over here. l felt something against my foot. There's something under me. Come look. Uhh. l don't see anything, Juni. Let's just concentrate on getting to shore. 
Okay, it's about 200 yards. 
lf we kick steadily at one foot per kick, we will reach it in, um... 25 minutes? l don't know. 
My calculator doesn't work. 
Whoa. Whoa. Juni, what did you do? 
The air's coming out of our suits. 
We're heading towards shore. 
"Travel heavy." 
- Good idea. All right. 
- Give it a rest. Ugh. Ugh. 
Okay, we're going to set up a campsite, put up the tent, build a little fire. And roast marshmallows? 
l can't believe this. What happened? Nothing that's just it. 
That was supposed to make an instant campfire, and that was supposed to make a shelter. None of our gadgets work. You mean 
we have to use our heads? Yes. Ouch. Big office...... 
Director of the O.S.S.'s office. Big. Did you find the source 
Page 16/34
of equal or greater power? 
lt emanates from the north side of the island. Have you located the lsland Man? He's somewhere underground. Yeah, well, start digging. l am on my way. 
Come on, Juni. Let's go check out the island. l just set up camp. See? 
Sure wish Gary was here. He'd want 
to find out who was behind all this. - Aw, man. 
- All right, let's go. 
Wow. This place is amazing. 
Check out that rock. 
Looks like a hot dog. Uh-huh. Well, l have seen enough. Let's go back to the beach. - What? Listen. 
- l hear something humming. 
Somebody here has power. 
We need to find out who and for what. Destination Ukata. Estimated time of arrival one minute and counting. 
How fast are we going? 
- 85 knots. Well... go faster. 
- With pleasure. 
Faster. 
Faster. 
- Faster. Can't go faster. Faster. 
- l broke the fast thingy. 
Faster. 
Faster. 
All right..... now what? 
This is terrific. You know, this is just great. You really did it this time, Gerti. Are you kicking me? 
No. l am way over here, cheese ball. l am going to zap that sucker to bits. Come here. 
Wait. 
Save it for the Cortezes. Yeah. Excellent idea. l don't get it. I saw it go through this wall. What's your assessment, Juni? 
l'd think better with food in my belly. l think we should go up there and check it out. Up there... To the top of the volcano? 
Page 17/34
Yep. Not even if my micrograpplers were working. Gary would be brave enough to do it. Nope. Nothing you can say can change my mind. What did you just say? l didn't. 
Race you to the top. 
"Volcano." 
Juni, stay back. 
lt's not active. 
Juni. 
- What are you waiting for? 
- Get me out of here. 
lf my auto retractor was working, 
l'd get us both back up there. 
Okay. l am going to grab your hand. 
Okay. 
- My cellphone. Ugh. Why'd you stop? 
- Something wrong? Close your eyes. Why? - Juni. What? 
- l am sorry. 
How long have we been falling? 
l don't know. My watch doesn't tell time. Best guess? l'd say about three hours. Feels like four. 
How could you be eating 
at a time like this? 
You know that tickling sensation you 
get when you fall? Of course. 
That pretty much went 
away after the first hour. 
What happened? 
l don't know. We're floating. 
Who are you? Do you see something? 
Over there, hiding. What do you want? l want to get down. l am Carmen Cortez, special agent of the O.S.S. 
l am Romero, sole inhabitant of this 
island of Leeke Leeke...... 
...sole human inhabitant, that is. 
And you are? Tired and hungry. 
Nice to meet you, Tired and Hungry. 
Careful. 
You will crush my island. Sorry. 
We just fell four hours. 
We're a little clumsy right now. 
Page 18/34
You weren't falling. 
lt was an illusion. 
Magic? 
Science. 
Quickly, we must get somewhere safe. l am a genetic specialist. l needed a controlled environment for my experiments. The creatures we have been hearing? My experiments..... run amok. What happened? l thought l would 
make a fortune from it. 
Kids everywhere would have their own miniature zoos, right there in their bedrooms. A miniature zoo? God's creatures... on a manageable scale. 
Unbelievable. l called it "Romero's Zoo" genetically miniaturized animals. 
Lions, tigers, bears, penguins..... Monkeys. 
Monkeys in a barrel. Be careful. 
Careful. 
One day, l accidentally mixed up 
two or three different test tubes 
and created a new species.... altogether. Romero's Zoo Too.... 
an entirely new..... miniature zoo.... where each species is unlike any 
creature you have ever seen. Horse-fly? Cat-fish. 
Spider-monkey? 
Bull-frog. 
Uh... slizzards. 
Whoa. Stay away from those. 
And so, l started to think, "lf only l could make them all a wee bit bigger," You know, for kids with meatier hands. That's where things went very wrong. l applied a growth serum, 
and they took to it all too well. 
No. And l have been locked 
up in here ever since. 
l am afraid to go out there again. 
They have tried to gobble me up on more than one occasion. Why do they despise me so? 
Page 19/34
l created them. 
Do you think... God stays in Heaven because he, too, lives in fear of what he is created.... ....here on Earth? Stop looking at me 
like that. l am no loon. 
What l am still trying to figure out 
is why this island doesn't show up 
on even our most advanced satellites. 
l created a cloaking device to 
shield my island from curious eyes. 
Anything electronically powered that comes within a mile radius instantly shuts down. Any radar that passes over me is displaced, creating the illusion that my island 
doesn't exist. The Transmooker device. 
How did you know? 
Your cloaking device is highly coveted. People everywhere are trying 
to get their hands on it. 
Are you sure we're the only humans here? There they are... two children, 
judging by their size. What is this? 
It's a miniature of the island. 
The center point of the volcano 
provides a gravitational basis.... 
for which my miniature creatures can line up exactly to their larger clone counterparts. So, wherever your miniature creatures are on this model, it's where the bigger ones are outside? Correct. l can keep track of 
their whereabouts this way. See? 
The two intruder children are being chased by a slizzard. Gary and Gerti. Leave them. We have to go help them. They shouldn't be snooping around my island to begin with. 
l am with you, dude. We have to help them. l am not going out there. l will be eaten. - What a bizarre man. Help us. Help. 
- Help us. Help. Somebody. 
What are you guys doing down there? 
That's real funny, clown. Get us out. 
We tried to activate our micrograpplers, but they didn't deploy. Nothing works here. Yeah, we know that now. 
Page 20/34
Thanks for the update, carrot top. 
Juni, come back. They need our help. Oh, l will help them. 
l want to get him back over here so l can push him back over myself. Hurry up. Come on. Here, Gary. Give me your hand. 
Thank you, Carmen. 
Here, Gerti... give me your hand. Just wait till my father gets here. Your father's coming? Where are you taking me now, Carmen? Hold on. 
Why are you still hiding? We're kids, not monsters. What's the difference? Relax. They're O.S.S. agents, as well. Level one. They're Donnagon's kids. 
Agent Donnagon? You work for the O.S.S., don't you? l work for a man named Donnagon. Who is this guy? Donnagon's not 
interested in your creatures. Why not? The Transmooker device that hides your island that's what Donnagon really wants. That's not nearly as interesting. 
Now that Donnagon's head of the O.S.S., he has the power to take it from you. What are you babbling about now, Juni? The Transmooker you took from the president's daughter, Gary. lt was just a prototype. The real Transmooker device is here on this island. It's even more powerful.... and can shut down all technology on the planet. You said your father's on his way. l think he's coming to pick it up. 
You're all liars. Do you really think you're going to turn us on our own father? Did your dad tell you the mission you went on was just a set-up for Carmen and me? Why not? He has his reasons. That's what being a good spy is all about trust no one. How to Be a Spy, we have read it. 
Well, read it again. 
A good spy makes no binding 
connections with family or friends. 
Well, l don't believe in that, do you? lf you want to be a good spy, you better believe it. 
Page 21/34

My father's a great spy, so let's grow up, shall we? Whatever my father's done, 
it's what it takes to play in the big world like it or not. Come on, Gerti. Let's go. He is right. Oh. Why can't you 
side with me just once? 
There are no sides. You're right, and he is right, too. That's what being a spy means. Well, l don't like it. Then quit. 
l will. Yeah, right. 
Donnagon was right. Their Dragon Spy 
doesn't show up anywhere on radar. 
l am not interested in finding the sub. Remember that year l insisted on doing the children's dental work... myself? 
How could l forget? Well... l installed a nonelectrical tracking device in their teeth... my own invention. But l haven't been 
able to test it, until... now. 
Honey, it works. Whoa... Hard to believe. But according to this... 
They're in the middle of the ocean. 
Above sea level. 
But where they are on the map, 
there's no land mass. How can that be? "Now what?" 
Something's got us. 
Aaah. What is it? Your mother. Mom? 
We wanted to join you. Are you nuts? 
We needed a bigger boat. 
And we brought real food..... 
none of that freeze-dried stuff you think's so chic. Son-in-law. Yeah? Make yourself useful. Why are you here? We wanted to help get our grandchildren back. Ah-ah. 
We will get our grandchildren back. Gracias. Oh, wait. You have got something on your lip. What? Got it. Uh, Mom, Dad, l am a big girl now, and l can take care of myself, okay? 
And Gregorio and l, we can take care of finding our children. No, you don't seem to understand. This isn't you and Gregorio 
simply saving the world again. 
This time, we all have much more to lose Page 22/34

if you fail, Carmen and Juni. 
You cannot come with us. 
lt is too dangerous. 
Oh, you mean, uh, 
we can't handle ourselves, huh? 
May l have my moustache back, please? lf Donnagon really is on his way 
we have to destroy the Transmooker. Where is it? 
The other side of the island. 
Not easy to get to. 
The journey alone is more dangerous than the Transmooker itself. l made sure of it. Show us. You're not going out there, are you? We don't have much choice, do we? 
With those monsters running around? l don't believe they're monsters. 
Maybe you shouldn't, either. 
Well, what should l believe? l don't know. You're always in here hiding. Maybe they just want to be with you. Be with me? They want to be picking me out of 
their teeth, is what they want to be. You just got to show them who's boss. You're not afraid? 
First thing you got to do is.... 
......fall into this pit. 
How does it work? 
Supposedly, they run magnetically. We should be able to ride 
over a determined path. 
We have to get the 
Transmooker before they do. Right. - Slizzards. 
- Oh, no. 
This is cool. 
- Juni. 
- Juni. 
- I think we should get off now. 
- Why? Trust me. 
- Aaah. 
- Jump now. 
Gary and Gerti. l told you they 
were following us. Uh. 
Page 23/34
You have one new message. Message one. Hello, Alexandra, it's me agent Juni Cortez. l am on a mission. l know l shouldn't be. But l had an idea for you and your father. Simply tell him you need to talk to him. Tell him it's nothing urgent, 
but someday it might be urgent. 
And you need to open the 
communication lines right now. 
So give me a call. Love to hear from you. And right now it's about... 
Silly me, l forgot my watch doesn't tell time. Heh. And, uh..... 
Something's wrong. Take the wheel. 
Got to go. Good luck. Juni. End of message. Gregorio, the signal requires that you go around it. He won't listen to you. He won't listen to you, Mother. 
Choose another direction..... 
He wants to make sure 
he loses the children again. 
lf you would only listen to us and do what we're saying you're tracking them all wrong. lngrid, tell him he's tracking them all wrong. Mom, Dad, l have told you before, and l will tell you again, 
No backseat driving. 
Thank you. When Gregorio is at the wheel, no one tells him what to do. 
Turn here, honey. 
Sorry. Okay. You're sure 
you're reading that map correctly? 
The coordinates correspond to Carmen and Juni's current position. These are my children. And l will find them my way. 
Blah, blah, blah. l never understand a single word he's saying. Never. 
Not only were we set up, 
but l bet Donnagon knew all along 
that you'd hack your way into taking this assignment. l was wondering the same thing. Juni, open up. What? Aah. Aah. Dad installed these trackers in case we ever got lost. Hurry. Take mine out. 
Page 24/34
And why are we doing this? 
When we get lost, who saves us? Mom and Dad. Now, if Mom and Dad also disappear.... who's going to stop Donnagon from 
using the Transmooker device? 
Donnagon wants us all together so he can destroy the island and all of us with it. Mom and Dad, even Romero. We can't let Mom and Dad find us or Donnagon wins. - A big sacrifice. 
- Family is sacrifice. 
What happened? 
What did... what did you just do? 
We lost Carmen. 
And... and Juni? Juni's still on-line. l love you. 
That can't be. 
Okay, okay. What do we do? 
l don't know. 
Maybe this is like the mission of 
the spies who didn't want to be found. You know if they don't want to be found, maybe their position is compromised. Now, Gregorio, don't tell me 
you didn't have a back-up plan. 
lngrid, was Juni wearing that charm necklace l sent him for Christmas last year? He never takes it off. Then we got him. l was worried about Juni's well-being, so l put a tracer in his necklace. There he is. Thanks, Dad. Are you sure you don't want me to take over the wheel? That's funny. lt's funny. 
Back to work. Where are we? 
Well.... not far from the antechamber. l think it's behind us. 
Don't move. Maybe it's friendly. 
Maybe it's not. 
Let's go. 
lt's an underwater cave. We will have to go all the way around. That will take all day. There must be a faster..... 
- Wow... 
- What is this place? 
Page 25/34
- Do you think that's real gold? 
- Gross. This is so slimy. 
- l hate mold. l can hear your thoughts. - What? And you can hear mine. 
Our mouths aren't moving, but we can hear what we're thinking. Say something. How strange. We can only communicate by thought. Magic. Hmm. Think something. Um... your feet stink. 
l wonder. 
- Ohhh. Oh. Oh. Okay. 
- This place is really weird. Let's go. Good thinking. 
- Now, this is more like it. 
- Treasure. 
- Skeletons. Dead skeletons. 
- ls there any other kind? 
This must have been where the pirate prisoners and treasure were kept. 
This must have been a pretty special necklace for them to die fighting over it. One necklace to rule them all. 
Put it back, Juni. l didn't take it yet. l can read your mind, remember? 
This land is ancient and cursed. 
lf you take anything, 
you will doom us both. Let's go. 
Come on. l think l found a way out. Which way? l don't know, you pick, right or left? Right. - Wait a minute. Oh, no. 
- We went in a circle. What? 
- Come on. 
- Let's try it again. 
Come on, Juni. l know what we did wrong. We have got to go left. 
Maybe l should put this back. 
Uh-oh. Where are the dead skeletons? - Aaaah. 
- Carmen. 
Juni. 
Juni. 
- Help me. 
- Huh? 
Hey, "bonehead." 
Page 26/34
Oh, no. 
- Why is this happening? 
- l don't know. 
Wait a minute. You took something, didn't you? No. You told me not to. Why would l? 
- Oh. 
- Juni. Carmen. 
- Oh. 
- Juni. Carmen. 
- Wait. 
- Ah. 
l am sorry. 
- Carmen. 
- Carmen. 
- You too, huh? 
- Yeah. 
Where's your brother? 
Did he get eaten? 
No. He's out there looking for Juni. You know he squashed Juni's bug on purpose. Yeah, l know. Now he wants to squash Juni. Don't you think we 
should get out of here? 
- Oh. 
- Mm-hmm. 
- Carmen. l am dreaming. 
- l am totally dreaming. 
And l am hungry, too. 
- Oh. Oh. 
- Oh. 
You like honey-roasted ham and potatoes, don't you? That's what flavor this is. Highly nutritious. Packed with protein and essential carbs. Hyah. 
Everything a growing centaur needs. You're welcome. 
Well, well, well. Your friend 
likes freeze-dried. So does mine. 
All right, buddy. 
Let's kick their butts. 
Heh heh heh. We're waiting. Come on. Can't let you bust up my dad's machine, Juni. Whoa. So l guess l will just have to bust 
Page 27/34
you up. We can take them. 
Come on, buddy. We can take them. 
l don't think we can take them. 
Must try and help them. 
Must. So, even if your dad is behind all this, you'd still side with him over what's right? Right? How do you ever know what's right? Trust me, when the moment comes, you will know. l think that moment's come. 
- Come on. Show them who's boss. 
- Show them who's boss. l am the boss. l am the...... 
Oh. 
Oh. 
Look out. 
Forward, go, man. 
- Come on, spidey. 
- You can do it. Yeah. 
Your creature's lame. So are you, 
lame-o. lt's all over for you, squirt. Too bad your dork sister's 
not here to cheer me on. 
Hey. 
Hey. 
l don't want to hurt you, Carmen. 
You're so full of shiitake mushrooms. Put it down, Carmen. 
Put it down. 
- Okay. All right. 
- Gerti, a little assistance here. 
Don't look at me, brother. You are fighting a girl. You're going to lose. 
l am siding with you. Thanks. 
But just this once. 
Cortezes. 
You going to help me or not? 
Well, there it is. How do you know? 
Because it's big and weird and in 
the middle of the room. Good point. 
Careful, Juni. 
lf you don't shut it down right.... 
you can bring the entire world to an end. Thanks. l am serious. Well, we have to shut it down. This turns that off. 
Page 28/34

And that turns this off. 
He said there's something 
tricky about the third switch. 
Let's see. 
Too late, Gary. We got here first. Just stand up against the wall 
like a good boy and leave us alone. Nice try, but we 
brought friends this time. 
Romero. What are you doing outside of your cage? l have no idea. 
- Donnagon. Hello, agents. 
- Warming it up for me? 
Are you ready to cooperate this time, Romero? l, uh... Good. 
This should be pain... and simple. Oh. What did you do? He started the Transmooker. You said three switches. The entire world will shut down instantly. Good going, cheese ball. What do we do? You must bind together 
the three toggle switches. 
lt won't stay up. Machete elastic wonder. Machete elastic wonder. Here grab it. Oh. - Give it to me. Give it. Dad... 
- Give it to me. 
Give it to me... 
...or else. Give it to him, Carmen. Where'd it go? Where'd it go? l don't know. The spork took it. Back to its nest. No. l know where the nest is, Dad. l also have Romero's instruction book. Hey. Brat. Come on. 
lt's just over that big hill. Ohh. Ohh. Are you sure this is the right way? My watch has a GPS satellite, you dope. Wait a minute. How can this be? 
When you took out the Transmooker, the island cloaking device was shut down. Then what are we doing on foot? 
Later, Romero. 
There it is. 
Get up there, Dad. Come on. 
Okay, Magna Men, we're going to need a human Page 29/34
ladder starting right here. Carmen. 
What? 
An agent's only as good as her gadgets. They're heading for the beach. 
Help. 
Help. 
The kid was right. 
What are you doing? 
Trying to remote-pilot our submarine to the surface so we can get out of here. Get on your GPS and see 
where Mom and Dad are. 
This can't be right. This shows that they are right next to us. 
Oh, no. That's no way to greet 
your grandparents. Come on. Grandpa. - Ah, Juni. 
- Come here, come here. 
Always take this with you wherever you go, and l will always be there. l promise, Grandpa. Not you guys. Oh. You don't want to be rescued. You don't want to be saved. That's all right. We thought you might... you might need us. Go talk to your father. Dad. Hey, Mom. Come on, Dad. Look at me. Two spies who didn't want to be found? Yes. Yes. l like your thinking. 
But you know what? Those spies didn't have me for a mom. Come on. Thank you. Hey. l will always need you. 
- Come on. Carmen Elizabeth Juanita..... - Come here to your papa. You okay, hon? All right. lnformation. Quick. 
Okay, we have the Transmooker device, but we need to get off this island right now. What do you think we're here for? Let's go. We will explain it on the way. 
You won't believe who's behind this. lt couldn't be any more perfect. 
This better not be what l think it is. lt's all being taken care of, all right? Get the Transmooker device, Felix. Felix? Sorry, Gregorio. 
A little power goes a long way, doesn't it? Page 30/34

Reprogram this one, Gerti. 
l want to start by wiping the Cortez family from the face of the Earth. Uncle Felix, how could you? l am not your uncle. But we treated you like family. Donnagon said if l joined him, he... ....he wouldn't get rid of me 
like he's going to do to you guys. You can't argue with that. Do you still have power in your watch? Yep. Programming complete, Father. Thank you, Gerti. Try remote-piloting the choppers. Well, Cortezes, any last words? None that l can say in front of my children. Not to mention your mother. 
Let's settle this the old-fashioned way. Aah. Kick his butt. Yeah, kick his butt. - Not like that. 
- "Headbutt." 
Sleeper hold. 
Use his own weight against him. Yeah. - Ah, get up. 
- Do what l showed you last night. Suplex. 
- Even l can fight better than that. - Mom. Triple backflip. 
- Gerti? What did you...? Why? 
- Oh, don't even get me started. 
Just wait till Mom finds out you tried to take over the world again. 
No. Please, please, please. 
D... Don't tell your mother. Please? Uh, hello. Hello, there, Mr. President. By order of the president, 
you have been temporarily disavowed. You're fired. Uh. Looks like l lost this round, but l will be back. 
Hopefully, you're on the good side next time. We will see, but... 
...you never know. Don't worry. He gets out of line, l will straighten him out. You go, Gerti. 
You tried to save us. Why? 
Because you are my family. 
Page 31/34

You know... there isn't a man on this Earth we'd ever think would be good enough for our daughter, but, um... you come pretty close. By order of the president, you are the new director of the O.S.S. Congratulations. Do they..... are they..... 
Level one. 
- No, thanks. You don't want it? 
- l am leaving the O.S.S. 
l have seen what it takes to be a top spy, and l think l can be better use to the world by just being the best... me. 
But what about all the cool gadgets? l got the best gadget right here. Use number one, a stylish bracelet. See you around? Yes. - Go ahead. Say it. What? 
- l told you so. 
Never. 
Never. 
Wait. 
Uh....... 
Thank you. You got it, boss. 
Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. 
Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. 
Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. 
Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. 
l am not going out there. 
Oh, yes, you are. 
You're a spy, you're undercover, and you have to make them think you're a pop star. l can't sing. Who can these days? 
l can't tell you how many artists have used my Machete miracle microphone. # l can't sing # 
This will make you dance like Britney Lopez. Hey, what about me? 
This will make you play like Angus Van Santana. Cool. Now get out there and rock. # Who, what, when, where, and why # # Do l delight in #

My precious. We're nearing the

No. And then the next sentence is "The location radius where all the disappearances." Okay. We're nearing destination zone. The location

What is it? 
Okay, what is it? 
Okay. 
Well, well, well, well, whoo. 
Man, you're not an easy man to find, you and your island of Leeke Leeke. l am Dinky. Winks, that is. Heard you had a wild place here, and, uh, well, sir, l was thinking you might be interested in a little, uh, business proposition. - You ready? Theme park. 
- Think about it. 
Families on safari, crazy critters running all over the place. 
- Hey, there, fella. Uhh. 
- Whoa. 
You can see it already, can't you? Huh? We'd be great together. What do you say?

Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams 
By Robert Rodriguez 
Page 1/34
Hello, everyone. 
We want to welcome a very special guest to our park today the president's daughter. Big smile. Big smile. Hello, Alexandra. Where's your father? He will be here. l will make sure of it. 
Well, hey there, little miss first lady, l am Dinky Winks, owner of 
this fine establishment. 
You ready to ride the ride and shrill to the thrills, spills, and chills? 
Yes, l am. Right this way. 
Of course, that behind me..... 
The world famous Whippersnapper. 
Guaranteed to make grown men howl 
like a cub woke at weaning time. 
Over on our left... Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. The NerveWracker.... oh-ho, painful. Good fun. On your other left is, uh, well, my personal favorite..... The Vomiter. Now, we tell people not to ride it on a full stomach, but you know folks. 
They just don't listen. 
But... why bother with any of those? You're here for my latest and greatest. For your personal amusement and complete gratification, l humbly offer.... the Juggler. But is it fast? ls it fast? 
Well, let's see, shall we? 
The riders are strapped into the bubble. The hydrobot lifts the 
bubble high into the air. 
And spins it round and round as fast as the United States government will allow. The bubble spins, turns, flips, and bounces. And then...... it juggles you. 
l want to go on. 
l thought so. 
Now, understand the override precautions are top-notch, modified by yours truly. 
l thought her father was supposed to be here. The president has more pressing business than to spend an entire Sunday in a theme park. No one's that busy. 
Page 2/34
Have fun, kid. 
We will take it a little slow, 
just make it fun. 
Mm-hmm. Can't you get her down? 
Somebody's jammed the override. 
Why, that little troublemaker. 
Remain calm. Remain calm. We are the Secret Service. Everything is under control. There's nothing we can do, sir. What? The weight of our agents 
will prevent us from ascending 
the shaky precipice on which she now stands. She will fall. Don't we have any smaller agents? Bring me agents SK1 and SK2. 
Coming through. Coming through. 
We're ready. Use this... the latest gear. We get to keep them afterwards? 
- N... No. Yes. 
- Of course. Let's rock. 
You're sure they can handle this? 
lf not, there are two others who can. Bring me agents SK3 and SK4 as back-up. Ugh. Ugh. We got company. 
Gary and Gerti... 
What are they doing here? Ugh. 
Excuse me there, sport. 
Where did you get that? 
Latest in electro-riser technology, with new composite materials and A.l. brainology. l can see you don't know what l am talking about. Gary, this is my rescue. 
We will take it from here. 
"Latest gear," my butt. 
No, no, no. You will just make it worse. Now you done it. Over here. Get away 
from me. Alexandra, take my hand. 
Back off. I want my father to 
come up here and get me. 
But he's the president of the United States. No, he's my father. 
He was my father before he ever became president, and he should still be my father now. l want him up here. Sir, we have a situation. She's got the Transmooker. 
Page 3/34
This is now a code-red situation. Get her down now. 
The point is, 
you and your father need to have a talk. Up here may not be the best place. Come with me, and l promise you, 
the two of you will have that talk. How can you promise that? l am Level 2. l can order him to talk to you. 
Hi, Gerti. What are you doing? 
l am trying to stop the ride. 
Without disengaging the axis? Exactly. Then stop what you're doing. 
You see, the ride is designed 
to work like a giant magnet. 
lf you reverse the polarization, 
bye-bye, president's daughter. 
See you around. 
Okay. Wait. l took this from my 
father's office this morning. 
l am sure he will want it back. 
Careful. Look, Cortez, you take her down, and l will take this down. 
That way, we both look good. 
l am not doing this for looks, Gary. Thank goodness you're all right, Alexandra. We were worried sick. Oh, boys. 
l think this is what you're looking for. She swiped it from the president. Oh, you're in big trouble this time, missy. Wait a minute. l promised her she could talk to her father. 
Oh, she will talk to him, all right. We will make sure of that. 
- Promise me one thing...... 
- What? 
no more winky-dinky assignments. 
So, you want the Ukata assignment, huh? Your duties are assigned to you by the agency same as everyone, same as me. l know. lt's just that 
we have learned so much. 
Juni and l are more than capable 
of taking bigger assignments. 
Page 4/34
But that's not your decision to make. 
The Spy Kids organization is still new, and if you're a Level 3 or even a Level 2, you cannot go on a mission alone. 
You need more experience. 
Come on. OK, Mom, if you're looking for top secret information, just go straight to the source. Welcome to the Pentagon. 
How did you do that? You can't do that. There is no hacking in this household. 
l know. Sorry. Show me that again. 
l know this hair thing is one of my weakest points. Wait one minute. You're going to look cool. ln fact, you're looking cooler, right? 
Like me. Like Poppy. 
And it's kind of em-o-tion-al to me. 
You know? Uh-oh. A knot. 
We are going to... 
You... Uh-huh, uh-huh. We got it. 
That's my boy. Last touch. 
Hup, hup. You want me to tie it for you? No, it's okay. R.A.L.P.H. can do it. 
Bow tie, R.A.L.P.H., and not too tight. Thanks, R.A.L.P.H. 
lnteresting. But... 
he can never, ever replace..... 
.....me. Pow. 
Not yet, but l think that new 
upgrade comes in next week. Uh-huh. 
- Oh. Only "joking." 
- Hey. 
- Kids. Kids. 
- Kids. Kids. 
"Joking"? 
Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Remember, kids, this is a very important night for your father. And if he's named director of the O.S.S., be sure to stand up and give him a big hug, all right? What if Dad doesn't win? 
Well, then, give him a bigger hug. 
Oh, Yao Ling, Wa Ling, this is Danielle and Dione Daluc. Hello. Hi. 
They created lnfolink, sort of an online trading system for swapping international secrets. 
Page 5/34
- Hi. Oh, hey. 
- Hello. Champagne? 
Can't have any of that. Sorry. 
Something doesn't feel right. 
No wonder your buddy's here. 
Your buddy with the weird laugh. 
He does not have a weird laugh. We were just... talking about you. Really? Wow. You look great, Carmen. 
You want to dance? Sure. 
l don't think that's a good idea, Gary. Family rules say you need to 
ask my father's permission. 
You know, you should have 
had that suit tailored, Juni. 
lt's bunching up around your gut, 
and it makes your head look way too big. You have to excuse my little brother. He's still a little upset 
about the... Juggler incident. 
A good agent controls his temper. 
Just be glad my dad isn't here. He gets really psycho about this sort of thing. Hi, Dad. Um, you remember Gary. 
He's in our organization. 
l was just asking your daughter for a dance. You know how to dance? Fairly well, sir. What kind of dances? All types of dances. What about tango? Yes. Mambo? Fairly well. Rumba? Yes. Cha-cha-cha? Seven steps. Bossa nova? Mm-hmm. Merengue? Of course. What about waltz? 
Y... Yeah, l can waltz. Show me. 
"Right." 
Something like that. 
All right. You can go to dance. 
Watch your older sister. 
Alexandra? Yes? 
What are you doing in there? Dancing. Do you always carry this 
many Secret Service around? 
My dad's idea.... 
he's gotten a little..... paranoid. Well, would you dance... with me? No. 
Page 6/34
All right, hold on a second, guys. 
Level 2.... break it up. 
Why not? 
l only dance... ballet. 
What an incredible coincidence. 
So do l. 
Well, Juni, l must say, 
you're a man of many talents. 
One tries. 
Uh, could you find your seats? 
We're ready to start. 
"I must go." 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
the president of the United States. Thank you. 
l am proud of the O.S.S. and their 
newly formed Spy Kids division. 
For their outstanding 
accomplishments yesterday. 
Gary and Gerti Giggles 
not only saved my daughter... 
What is he talking about? 
l saved her. Juni. But.... 
...more importantly, if not most importantly, they safely retrieved the Transmooker device that my daughter accidentally took from my office earlier that day. 
Now it is my great pleasure to announce the new director of the O.S.S.... 
.......Donnagon Giggles. 
Gary and Gerti Giggles are the kind of agents we need to turn the O.S.S. around. l am proud to award them 
these Level 1 badges, 
What? Which will enable them 
to take on real missions, 
something challenging, 
like the Ukata assignment. Yes. 
l wanted that assignment. 
This is so unfair. 
l am proud to claim them as our organization's top Spy Kid operatives. Something's not right. And l am also proud to claim them, 
of course, as my children. 
Page 7/34
This is all wrong. To our Spy Kids. To our Spy Kids. To our Spy Kids. To our Spy Kids. To our Spy Kids. This ugh........ 
Secure the perimeter. 
Sleepers. 
They're after the Transmooker device. Take them down. 
- Pull. 
- Pull. 
- Get off, squirt. 
- Ugh. 
Give me that back. 
- You all right, sir? 
- Yeah. 
Come here. Juni, get off of him. 
No, no. They took the Transmooker device. They took the Transmooker device. The following Spy Kid cadets 
please report to the psychic abilities seminar Mike Cardenas and Daniel Duluth. lt's my turn, too. Are you sure? 
All right, your last name is? 
Hold on a second. l had the Transmooker in my hand, but you know Juni..... he wanted to claim it for himself. Okay, that should do it. Thank you, son. Right. lf that Transmooker device falls into the wrong hands, we're doomed. 
Thank you, Mr. President. That will be all. We're doomed. Understood, sir. 
Here. 
"Floop's Fooglie" 
Starring Minion and Carmenita....... Thanks. 
l was fired. l know. l hacked into the O.S.S. data files and saw the news. lt was probably my fault, l suppose. l am sorry. Well, l guess that's that. Let's go to the tree house. l got an idea. l guess l could always set up a small detective agency out here or something. You're thinking small again, Juni. The old tree house needs another helicopter pad. 
Page 8/34
lt needs a paint job, is what it needs. Your name? Carmen Elizabeth Juanita Echo Sky Brava Cortez. 
Your name? 
Juni Rocket Racer Rebelde Cortez. 
You know... l am kind of looking 
forward to retirement, 
get back to all the projects and dreams l left behind. Oh, stop it, Juni. 
Look, do you want your job back or not? That's right... reinstated Level 2. So now we can get back the 
missing Transmooker. How? 
Looks like Gary and Gerti are about to get briefed on the Ukata assignment. We should listen in. 
ls R.A.L.P.H. still at your office? lf they haven't cleaned it out yet. R.A.L.P.H., get to the briefing room. We need you to spy on Gary and Gerti. Make sure no one sees you. 
There is a Bermuda Triangle of sorts off the coast of Madagascar. 
As you may remember, this is an area where some of our O.S.S. cargo ships have been disappearing. Good boy, R.A.L.P.H. The survivors of these disappearances tell delusional tales of a..... 
mysterious island 
populated by strange creatures. 
Obviously, no land mass is 
located anywhere near there, so... these tales were dismissed, 
and the agents fired. However..... the magnet ship that captured the Transmooker device was last seen in this same area. So, we need a small ship, piloted by two small agents to go in and take a closer look. lf you find anything out of the ordinary, you return, you report it back here. - We accept. We accept. 
- You bet we accept. 
Come home, R.A.L.P.H. Good work. 
lt's a great assignment, but Gary 
Page 9/34
and Gerti have it, and l am fired. 
And l am reassigning you to the O.S.S. Don't tell me you're hacking into... Already done. Level 2 status reinstated. 
Carmen, you can't do this. 
l already did it. 
l'd take it one step further. 
We're assigning ourselves 
to the Ukata assignment. 
l am programming a new destination for Gary and Gerti. Now, that, l got to be a part of. State your name, please. Gary Giggles. Access denied. lt knows you're not him. Confirmed. 
New destination? How about..... 
Gobi Desert? Stop it, Juni. 
What? Don't want your boyfriend to go so far away? He's not my boyfriend. Okay, then. Destination confirmed. 
There. What did we just do again? 
We're going to get the Transmooker 
device back so we can clear your name. We just have to solve the case before anybody finds out what we're up to. Are you with me? OK. Then let's go. 
"Hello?" 
Hello? Hey, what are you doing up there? Sorry, we thought you were somebody else. Who gave you a key? 
Did you forget who built you this place? Come down from there. 
l brought you all-new gadgets. 
Check it out. The very latest spy 
watch, total communication center, 
right there on your wrist. Cellphone, lnternet access, satellite TV... you name it. 
That baby will do everything but tell you what time it is. lt doesn't tell time? 
No, there was so much stuffed into it, there was no more room for the clock. Cool. Are you sure these are new? We can't be running around with outdated equipment. Close your eyes and hold out your wrist. l am going to give you the one gadget you 
Page 10/34

should always carry. A rubber band? No. It's a Machete elastic wonder. 
lt's a rubber band. 
Yeah, but it's also the world's greatest gadget 999 uses, and the important thing is you have to figure out what 
those uses are... with this. He's right. Use number one... A stylish bracelet. Use number two... Ahh. 
l am going to make a fortune with these. Are you sure this is going to work? Just be cool. 
As far as anybody knows, you're back on the force. Hey, Uncle Felix. Oh. 
l am not your uncle. l know. lt's just easier to call you that. Um, you don't mind, do you? Of course not. 
Well, welcome back, Juni. Says here you were reinstated. Sure does, doesn't it? He was fired and rehired all in the same day. Okay. 
Let me bring up the keys 
to the Dragon Spy Five. 
- Cake. 
- Six o'clock. 
Wow. You're looking good 
with the new gear, Carmen. 
Their latest stuff. Very cool... 
only we had that weeks ago. 
Here's what's really new. 
Nanotechnology...... 
everything you're wearing 
is right here on my wrist. 
lt's superaccurate and, oh, so light. lt even tells time. How did you get that? Well, it's all prototype, Juni. 
You can't be running around 
with those mass-produced gadgets. 
Just means everyone's got them. 
l always go with the prototype. 
Sure, they're a little buggy, 
But l can deal. 
l.... l accidentally squashed him 
on my way out of the O.S.S. building. Uh. Page 11/34

Sorry about that. He was outdated, anyway, so think of it as a mercy killing. 
Gary and Gerti Giggles, you have 
assignment SElKJU9. Good luck. 
Don't hurt yourselves with that outdated gear. Remember, an agent is only as good as his gadgets. What? You have the Ukata assignment? 
Very nice. You will love it. 
Thanks, Uncle Felix. 
l am not your uncle. 
Oh, nice sub. 
Welcome to the Dragon Spy DLX. 
Seems like they get more and more sophisticated each month. Everything is automated. 
Now picking your nose. 
Little brothers. 
Let's check our lunchboxes 
for mission updates. 
Sorry, R.A.L.P.H. You were the best spy on the force. Juni, leave it alone. He's dead. Thanks to your buddy Gary. lt was an 
accident. You like him and believe him? l don't like him...... that much. 
Gary's a bad guy, Carmen. Maybe l know that. l think l can change him. 
l do not understand you. And you never will. French fry, sir? Uh. Uh. Ow. 
Give me that. 
Strange... tales of a mysterious island, disappearing ships, mysterious creatures, and yet, no information anywhere 
on the O.S.S. cargo or the magnet ship. What's Donnagon doing there? 
He wasn't O.S.S. director yet. 
These are old O.S.S. secrets. And l know just the person we can call for advice. Who? 
# Who # 
# Who # 
# What, when # 
# Where # 
# What, when # 
# Where # 
# Who, what, when # 
Page 12/34
# Where and why # 
# l delight in what... # 
# Do l intend to find, find # 
# This time # 
# Run around, jumping down # 
# Bounce and bound and... # 
# Find another way to duck and hide # # This isle of... # 
# Dreams # 
- Hello? Yes. 
- One moment, please. 
Cut. 
Cut. 
Who is it again? 
Juni Cortez. What can l do for you? l mean, you have done so much for me. Your robot counterparts are the surprise hit characters of my show. Say hello. 
# Hello # 
# Hello # 
Actually, Carmen wants a word with 
Mr. Minion. Oh. He is right here. 
- Minion is practicing a 4-part harmony. - You have one minute. 
Bueno? How you doing, Minion? 
Things are a little Floopy around here for my taste, but it's a living. 
l need some information on your favorite subject the O.S.S. l need to make a call. Okay, you ready? Ukata... 
Transmooker.... The president's daughter is unavailable. Manage. Press "1" to record. Mean anything to you? 
Smells like the work of Donnagon Giggles. He had first contact with 
the Transmooker technology. 
You think Donnagon's the one behind all this? You're talking to a man with four heads. Trust me... the guy is dirt. What should we look for? First, find the island. Then find the lsland Man. That would have been Donnagon's contact. Okay. Thanks, Minion. Be a good girl and swat your brother for me. Oh, l will. 
Page 13/34

Something's wrong. Take the wheel. Got to go. Good luck. 
Slow down. We're nearing destination zone. The radius where all the 
disappearances occurred is right... .....here. 
We have been shut down. 
Hold onto something. 
All power is off..... 
even the emergency power. 
My flashlight doesn't even work. 
We're stuck, aren't we? 
Let's get out of here. 
- Rebreathers. Rebreathers. 
- You got to do it by hand. What next? - Nope. 
- Hand, Carmen. 
- Unbelievable. 
- "Low-tech." 
Here we go. 
Should we travel light or heavy? We may not be coming back down here. Let's go heavy. - Inflate-a-suits? 
- We don't have much choice. 
At least the "masks" work. 
l think it's because they're 
valve-operated, not electrical-based. - lt's so strange. Good luck. 
- You too. Stay close. 
- Oh, great. l am fat. 
- Was it supposed to do this? 
lt has an electrical automatic 
shut-off which didn't work. 
Luckily, we ran out of air before the suits exploded. Well, we can still laugh. At what? At whatever you can imagine Gary and Gerti are doing right about now. Gerti, where are we? Well, according to my coordinates, we are... l think that.... Camel poop. 
Someone's going to pay. Cortezes...... l like your new office. lt's smaller..... cozy. Especially smaller. 
- Oh. So many successful missions. Page 14/34
- Amazing, isn't it? Remember this one? Oh. - Which mission is that? Mexico. 
- Of course. 
Hmm. Actually, that was the one mission we never accomplished. lngrid..... don't start with your parents again. lt's funny you should mention them. No. When l mention your parents, 
it is the exact opposite of funny. Doesn't it bother you that we 
never got their full blessing? 
Frankly, you deserve another chance to show them. All right, all right. 
lnvite them if you want, 
but l won't be here. 
Tell them that l had a... 
l had to go on another mission, 
that... that we're having a little problem on the moon. My father loves the moon. You invited them already, didn't you? Mmm... define "invite." Cortezes. 
What? l have some bad news. 
May l come in? 
Certainly, sir. Yes, sir. Great. 
Here "he" is. 
Two of our Spy Kid operatives 
are lost on the Ukata assignment. 
Your children had that assignment. l am so sorry, Donnagon. How can we help? Actually, my children are safe 
somewhere in the Gobi Desert, l believe. I am sorry to say that Carmen and Juni are somehow the ones on the Ukata assignment.... a computing error of some kind. 
Communications? None. 
Their Dragon Spy ship doesn't show up on radar or satellite. Greg, lngrid, you guys risked your lives 
once before to save me. 
Let me go now and personally bring your children back. No. Thank you. 
Thank you, Donnagon, but, respectfully, we have to do this ourselves. 
lf you could provide tactical back-up Page 15/34

and surveillance support of our efforts, we will leave immediately. Okay, yeah. Uh, lngrid... l know this may be 
a bad time, but, um..... 
Your parents are here. 
But you guys told me you 
were coming next Tuesday. 
This is a very dangerous assignment, and you have to wait here. Well, we want to help. Don't worry. You taught me everything l know. Yes..... 
but not everything we know. Of course not, Dad. See you in a few hours. Thanks, honey. l still don't like him. 
Juni...... was that there before? 
That wasn't there a minute ago, was it? Are you kicking me? l am way over here. l felt something against my foot. There's something under me. Come look. Uhh. l don't see anything, Juni. Let's just concentrate on getting to shore. 
Okay, it's about 200 yards. 
lf we kick steadily at one foot per kick, we will reach it in, um... 25 minutes? l don't know. 
My calculator doesn't work. 
Whoa. Whoa. Juni, what did you do? 
The air's coming out of our suits. 
We're heading towards shore. 
"Travel heavy." 
- Good idea. All right. 
- Give it a rest. Ugh. Ugh. 
Okay, we're going to set up a campsite, put up the tent, build a little fire. And roast marshmallows? 
l can't believe this. What happened? Nothing that's just it. 
That was supposed to make an instant campfire, and that was supposed to make a shelter. None of our gadgets work. You mean 
we have to use our heads? Yes. Ouch. Big office...... 
Director of the O.S.S.'s office. Big. Did you find the source 
Page 16/34
of equal or greater power? 
lt emanates from the north side of the island. Have you located the lsland Man? He's somewhere underground. Yeah, well, start digging. l am on my way. 
Come on, Juni. Let's go check out the island. l just set up camp. See? 
Sure wish Gary was here. He'd want 
to find out who was behind all this. - Aw, man. 
- All right, let's go. 
Wow. This place is amazing. 
Check out that rock. 
Looks like a hot dog. Uh-huh. Well, l have seen enough. Let's go back to the beach. - What? Listen. 
- l hear something humming. 
Somebody here has power. 
We need to find out who and for what. Destination Ukata. Estimated time of arrival one minute and counting. 
How fast are we going? 
- 85 knots. Well... go faster. 
- With pleasure. 
Faster. 
Faster. 
- Faster. Can't go faster. Faster. 
- l broke the fast thingy. 
Faster. 
Faster. 
All right..... now what? 
This is terrific. You know, this is just great. You really did it this time, Gerti. Are you kicking me? 
No. l am way over here, cheese ball. l am going to zap that sucker to bits. Come here. 
Wait. 
Save it for the Cortezes. Yeah. Excellent idea. l don't get it. I saw it go through this wall. What's your assessment, Juni? 
l'd think better with food in my belly. l think we should go up there and check it out. Up there... To the top of the volcano? 
Page 17/34
Yep. Not even if my micrograpplers were working. Gary would be brave enough to do it. Nope. Nothing you can say can change my mind. What did you just say? l didn't. 
Race you to the top. 
"Volcano." 
Juni, stay back. 
lt's not active. 
Juni. 
- What are you waiting for? 
- Get me out of here. 
lf my auto retractor was working, 
l'd get us both back up there. 
Okay. l am going to grab your hand. 
Okay. 
- My cellphone. Ugh. Why'd you stop? 
- Something wrong? Close your eyes. Why? - Juni. What? 
- l am sorry. 
How long have we been falling? 
l don't know. My watch doesn't tell time. Best guess? l'd say about three hours. Feels like four. 
How could you be eating 
at a time like this? 
You know that tickling sensation you 
get when you fall? Of course. 
That pretty much went 
away after the first hour. 
What happened? 
l don't know. We're floating. 
Who are you? Do you see something? 
Over there, hiding. What do you want? l want to get down. l am Carmen Cortez, special agent of the O.S.S. 
l am Romero, sole inhabitant of this 
island of Leeke Leeke...... 
...sole human inhabitant, that is. 
And you are? Tired and hungry. 
Nice to meet you, Tired and Hungry. 
Careful. 
You will crush my island. Sorry. 
We just fell four hours. 
We're a little clumsy right now. 
Page 18/34
You weren't falling. 
lt was an illusion. 
Magic? 
Science. 
Quickly, we must get somewhere safe. l am a genetic specialist. l needed a controlled environment for my experiments. The creatures we have been hearing? My experiments..... run amok. What happened? l thought l would 
make a fortune from it. 
Kids everywhere would have their own miniature zoos, right there in their bedrooms. A miniature zoo? God's creatures... on a manageable scale. 
Unbelievable. l called it "Romero's Zoo" genetically miniaturized animals. 
Lions, tigers, bears, penguins..... Monkeys. 
Monkeys in a barrel. Be careful. 
Careful. 
One day, l accidentally mixed up 
two or three different test tubes 
and created a new species.... altogether. Romero's Zoo Too.... 
an entirely new..... miniature zoo.... where each species is unlike any 
creature you have ever seen. Horse-fly? Cat-fish. 
Spider-monkey? 
Bull-frog. 
Uh... slizzards. 
Whoa. Stay away from those. 
And so, l started to think, "lf only l could make them all a wee bit bigger," You know, for kids with meatier hands. That's where things went very wrong. l applied a growth serum, 
and they took to it all too well. 
No. And l have been locked 
up in here ever since. 
l am afraid to go out there again. 
They have tried to gobble me up on more than one occasion. Why do they despise me so? 
Page 19/34
l created them. 
Do you think... God stays in Heaven because he, too, lives in fear of what he is created.... ....here on Earth? Stop looking at me 
like that. l am no loon. 
What l am still trying to figure out 
is why this island doesn't show up 
on even our most advanced satellites. 
l created a cloaking device to 
shield my island from curious eyes. 
Anything electronically powered that comes within a mile radius instantly shuts down. Any radar that passes over me is displaced, creating the illusion that my island 
doesn't exist. The Transmooker device. 
How did you know? 
Your cloaking device is highly coveted. People everywhere are trying 
to get their hands on it. 
Are you sure we're the only humans here? There they are... two children, 
judging by their size. What is this? 
It's a miniature of the island. 
The center point of the volcano 
provides a gravitational basis.... 
for which my miniature creatures can line up exactly to their larger clone counterparts. So, wherever your miniature creatures are on this model, it's where the bigger ones are outside? Correct. l can keep track of 
their whereabouts this way. See? 
The two intruder children are being chased by a slizzard. Gary and Gerti. Leave them. We have to go help them. They shouldn't be snooping around my island to begin with. 
l am with you, dude. We have to help them. l am not going out there. l will be eaten. - What a bizarre man. Help us. Help. 
- Help us. Help. Somebody. 
What are you guys doing down there? 
That's real funny, clown. Get us out. 
We tried to activate our micrograpplers, but they didn't deploy. Nothing works here. Yeah, we know that now. 
Page 20/34
Thanks for the update, carrot top. 
Juni, come back. They need our help. Oh, l will help them. 
l want to get him back over here so l can push him back over myself. Hurry up. Come on. Here, Gary. Give me your hand. 
Thank you, Carmen. 
Here, Gerti... give me your hand. Just wait till my father gets here. Your father's coming? Where are you taking me now, Carmen? Hold on. 
Why are you still hiding? We're kids, not monsters. What's the difference? Relax. They're O.S.S. agents, as well. Level one. They're Donnagon's kids. 
Agent Donnagon? You work for the O.S.S., don't you? l work for a man named Donnagon. Who is this guy? Donnagon's not 
interested in your creatures. Why not? The Transmooker device that hides your island that's what Donnagon really wants. That's not nearly as interesting. 
Now that Donnagon's head of the O.S.S., he has the power to take it from you. What are you babbling about now, Juni? The Transmooker you took from the president's daughter, Gary. lt was just a prototype. The real Transmooker device is here on this island. It's even more powerful.... and can shut down all technology on the planet. You said your father's on his way. l think he's coming to pick it up. 
You're all liars. Do you really think you're going to turn us on our own father? Did your dad tell you the mission you went on was just a set-up for Carmen and me? Why not? He has his reasons. That's what being a good spy is all about trust no one. How to Be a Spy, we have read it. 
Well, read it again. 
A good spy makes no binding 
connections with family or friends. 
Well, l don't believe in that, do you? lf you want to be a good spy, you better believe it. 
Page 21/34

My father's a great spy, so let's grow up, shall we? Whatever my father's done, 
it's what it takes to play in the big world like it or not. Come on, Gerti. Let's go. He is right. Oh. Why can't you 
side with me just once? 
There are no sides. You're right, and he is right, too. That's what being a spy means. Well, l don't like it. Then quit. 
l will. Yeah, right. 
Donnagon was right. Their Dragon Spy 
doesn't show up anywhere on radar. 
l am not interested in finding the sub. Remember that year l insisted on doing the children's dental work... myself? 
How could l forget? Well... l installed a nonelectrical tracking device in their teeth... my own invention. But l haven't been 
able to test it, until... now. 
Honey, it works. Whoa... Hard to believe. But according to this... 
They're in the middle of the ocean. 
Above sea level. 
But where they are on the map, 
there's no land mass. How can that be? "Now what?" 
Something's got us. 
Aaah. What is it? Your mother. Mom? 
We wanted to join you. Are you nuts? 
We needed a bigger boat. 
And we brought real food..... 
none of that freeze-dried stuff you think's so chic. Son-in-law. Yeah? Make yourself useful. Why are you here? We wanted to help get our grandchildren back. Ah-ah. 
We will get our grandchildren back. Gracias. Oh, wait. You have got something on your lip. What? Got it. Uh, Mom, Dad, l am a big girl now, and l can take care of myself, okay? 
And Gregorio and l, we can take care of finding our children. No, you don't seem to understand. This isn't you and Gregorio 
simply saving the world again. 
This time, we all have much more to lose Page 22/34

if you fail, Carmen and Juni. 
You cannot come with us. 
lt is too dangerous. 
Oh, you mean, uh, 
we can't handle ourselves, huh? 
May l have my moustache back, please? lf Donnagon really is on his way 
we have to destroy the Transmooker. Where is it? 
The other side of the island. 
Not easy to get to. 
The journey alone is more dangerous than the Transmooker itself. l made sure of it. Show us. You're not going out there, are you? We don't have much choice, do we? 
With those monsters running around? l don't believe they're monsters. 
Maybe you shouldn't, either. 
Well, what should l believe? l don't know. You're always in here hiding. Maybe they just want to be with you. Be with me? They want to be picking me out of 
their teeth, is what they want to be. You just got to show them who's boss. You're not afraid? 
First thing you got to do is.... 
......fall into this pit. 
How does it work? 
Supposedly, they run magnetically. We should be able to ride 
over a determined path. 
We have to get the 
Transmooker before they do. Right. - Slizzards. 
- Oh, no. 
This is cool. 
- Juni. 
- Juni. 
- I think we should get off now. 
- Why? Trust me. 
- Aaah. 
- Jump now. 
Gary and Gerti. l told you they 
were following us. Uh. 
Page 23/34
You have one new message. Message one. Hello, Alexandra, it's me agent Juni Cortez. l am on a mission. l know l shouldn't be. But l had an idea for you and your father. Simply tell him you need to talk to him. Tell him it's nothing urgent, 
but someday it might be urgent. 
And you need to open the 
communication lines right now. 
So give me a call. Love to hear from you. And right now it's about... 
Silly me, l forgot my watch doesn't tell time. Heh. And, uh..... 
Something's wrong. Take the wheel. 
Got to go. Good luck. Juni. End of message. Gregorio, the signal requires that you go around it. He won't listen to you. He won't listen to you, Mother. 
Choose another direction..... 
He wants to make sure 
he loses the children again. 
lf you would only listen to us and do what we're saying you're tracking them all wrong. lngrid, tell him he's tracking them all wrong. Mom, Dad, l have told you before, and l will tell you again, 
No backseat driving. 
Thank you. When Gregorio is at the wheel, no one tells him what to do. 
Turn here, honey. 
Sorry. Okay. You're sure 
you're reading that map correctly? 
The coordinates correspond to Carmen and Juni's current position. These are my children. And l will find them my way. 
Blah, blah, blah. l never understand a single word he's saying. Never. 
Not only were we set up, 
but l bet Donnagon knew all along 
that you'd hack your way into taking this assignment. l was wondering the same thing. Juni, open up. What? Aah. Aah. Dad installed these trackers in case we ever got lost. Hurry. Take mine out. 
Page 24/34
And why are we doing this? 
When we get lost, who saves us? Mom and Dad. Now, if Mom and Dad also disappear.... who's going to stop Donnagon from 
using the Transmooker device? 
Donnagon wants us all together so he can destroy the island and all of us with it. Mom and Dad, even Romero. We can't let Mom and Dad find us or Donnagon wins. - A big sacrifice. 
- Family is sacrifice. 
What happened? 
What did... what did you just do? 
We lost Carmen. 
And... and Juni? Juni's still on-line. l love you. 
That can't be. 
Okay, okay. What do we do? 
l don't know. 
Maybe this is like the mission of 
the spies who didn't want to be found. You know if they don't want to be found, maybe their position is compromised. Now, Gregorio, don't tell me 
you didn't have a back-up plan. 
lngrid, was Juni wearing that charm necklace l sent him for Christmas last year? He never takes it off. Then we got him. l was worried about Juni's well-being, so l put a tracer in his necklace. There he is. Thanks, Dad. Are you sure you don't want me to take over the wheel? That's funny. lt's funny. 
Back to work. Where are we? 
Well.... not far from the antechamber. l think it's behind us. 
Don't move. Maybe it's friendly. 
Maybe it's not. 
Let's go. 
lt's an underwater cave. We will have to go all the way around. That will take all day. There must be a faster..... 
- Wow... 
- What is this place? 
Page 25/34
- Do you think that's real gold? 
- Gross. This is so slimy. 
- l hate mold. l can hear your thoughts. - What? And you can hear mine. 
Our mouths aren't moving, but we can hear what we're thinking. Say something. How strange. We can only communicate by thought. Magic. Hmm. Think something. Um... your feet stink. 
l wonder. 
- Ohhh. Oh. Oh. Okay. 
- This place is really weird. Let's go. Good thinking. 
- Now, this is more like it. 
- Treasure. 
- Skeletons. Dead skeletons. 
- ls there any other kind? 
This must have been where the pirate prisoners and treasure were kept. 
This must have been a pretty special necklace for them to die fighting over it. One necklace to rule them all. 
Put it back, Juni. l didn't take it yet. l can read your mind, remember? 
This land is ancient and cursed. 
lf you take anything, 
you will doom us both. Let's go. 
Come on. l think l found a way out. Which way? l don't know, you pick, right or left? Right. - Wait a minute. Oh, no. 
- We went in a circle. What? 
- Come on. 
- Let's try it again. 
Come on, Juni. l know what we did wrong. We have got to go left. 
Maybe l should put this back. 
Uh-oh. Where are the dead skeletons? - Aaaah. 
- Carmen. 
Juni. 
Juni. 
- Help me. 
- Huh? 
Hey, "bonehead." 
Page 26/34
Oh, no. 
- Why is this happening? 
- l don't know. 
Wait a minute. You took something, didn't you? No. You told me not to. Why would l? 
- Oh. 
- Juni. Carmen. 
- Oh. 
- Juni. Carmen. 
- Wait. 
- Ah. 
l am sorry. 
- Carmen. 
- Carmen. 
- You too, huh? 
- Yeah. 
Where's your brother? 
Did he get eaten? 
No. He's out there looking for Juni. You know he squashed Juni's bug on purpose. Yeah, l know. Now he wants to squash Juni. Don't you think we 
should get out of here? 
- Oh. 
- Mm-hmm. 
- Carmen. l am dreaming. 
- l am totally dreaming. 
And l am hungry, too. 
- Oh. Oh. 
- Oh. 
You like honey-roasted ham and potatoes, don't you? That's what flavor this is. Highly nutritious. Packed with protein and essential carbs. Hyah. 
Everything a growing centaur needs. You're welcome. 
Well, well, well. Your friend 
likes freeze-dried. So does mine. 
All right, buddy. 
Let's kick their butts. 
Heh heh heh. We're waiting. Come on. Can't let you bust up my dad's machine, Juni. Whoa. So l guess l will just have to bust 
Page 27/34
you up. We can take them. 
Come on, buddy. We can take them. 
l don't think we can take them. 
Must try and help them. 
Must. So, even if your dad is behind all this, you'd still side with him over what's right? Right? How do you ever know what's right? Trust me, when the moment comes, you will know. l think that moment's come. 
- Come on. Show them who's boss. 
- Show them who's boss. l am the boss. l am the...... 
Oh. 
Oh. 
Look out. 
Forward, go, man. 
- Come on, spidey. 
- You can do it. Yeah. 
Your creature's lame. So are you, 
lame-o. lt's all over for you, squirt. Too bad your dork sister's 
not here to cheer me on. 
Hey. 
Hey. 
l don't want to hurt you, Carmen. 
You're so full of shiitake mushrooms. Put it down, Carmen. 
Put it down. 
- Okay. All right. 
- Gerti, a little assistance here. 
Don't look at me, brother. You are fighting a girl. You're going to lose. 
l am siding with you. Thanks. 
But just this once. 
Cortezes. 
You going to help me or not? 
Well, there it is. How do you know? 
Because it's big and weird and in 
the middle of the room. Good point. 
Careful, Juni. 
lf you don't shut it down right.... 
you can bring the entire world to an end. Thanks. l am serious. Well, we have to shut it down. This turns that off. 
Page 28/34

And that turns this off. 
He said there's something 
tricky about the third switch. 
Let's see. 
Too late, Gary. We got here first. Just stand up against the wall 
like a good boy and leave us alone. Nice try, but we 
brought friends this time. 
Romero. What are you doing outside of your cage? l have no idea. 
- Donnagon. Hello, agents. 
- Warming it up for me? 
Are you ready to cooperate this time, Romero? l, uh... Good. 
This should be pain... and simple. Oh. What did you do? He started the Transmooker. You said three switches. The entire world will shut down instantly. Good going, cheese ball. What do we do? You must bind together 
the three toggle switches. 
lt won't stay up. Machete elastic wonder. Machete elastic wonder. Here grab it. Oh. - Give it to me. Give it. Dad... 
- Give it to me. 
Give it to me... 
...or else. Give it to him, Carmen. Where'd it go? Where'd it go? l don't know. The spork took it. Back to its nest. No. l know where the nest is, Dad. l also have Romero's instruction book. Hey. Brat. Come on. 
lt's just over that big hill. Ohh. Ohh. Are you sure this is the right way? My watch has a GPS satellite, you dope. Wait a minute. How can this be? 
When you took out the Transmooker, the island cloaking device was shut down. Then what are we doing on foot? 
Later, Romero. 
There it is. 
Get up there, Dad. Come on. 
Okay, Magna Men, we're going to need a human Page 29/34
ladder starting right here. Carmen. 
What? 
An agent's only as good as her gadgets. They're heading for the beach. 
Help. 
Help. 
The kid was right. 
What are you doing? 
Trying to remote-pilot our submarine to the surface so we can get out of here. Get on your GPS and see 
where Mom and Dad are. 
This can't be right. This shows that they are right next to us. 
Oh, no. That's no way to greet 
your grandparents. Come on. Grandpa. - Ah, Juni. 
- Come here, come here. 
Always take this with you wherever you go, and l will always be there. l promise, Grandpa. Not you guys. Oh. You don't want to be rescued. You don't want to be saved. That's all right. We thought you might... you might need us. Go talk to your father. Dad. Hey, Mom. Come on, Dad. Look at me. Two spies who didn't want to be found? Yes. Yes. l like your thinking. 
But you know what? Those spies didn't have me for a mom. Come on. Thank you. Hey. l will always need you. 
- Come on. Carmen Elizabeth Juanita..... - Come here to your papa. You okay, hon? All right. lnformation. Quick. 
Okay, we have the Transmooker device, but we need to get off this island right now. What do you think we're here for? Let's go. We will explain it on the way. 
You won't believe who's behind this. lt couldn't be any more perfect. 
This better not be what l think it is. lt's all being taken care of, all right? Get the Transmooker device, Felix. Felix? Sorry, Gregorio. 
A little power goes a long way, doesn't it? Page 30/34

Reprogram this one, Gerti. 
l want to start by wiping the Cortez family from the face of the Earth. Uncle Felix, how could you? l am not your uncle. But we treated you like family. Donnagon said if l joined him, he... ....he wouldn't get rid of me 
like he's going to do to you guys. You can't argue with that. Do you still have power in your watch? Yep. Programming complete, Father. Thank you, Gerti. Try remote-piloting the choppers. Well, Cortezes, any last words? None that l can say in front of my children. Not to mention your mother. 
Let's settle this the old-fashioned way. Aah. Kick his butt. Yeah, kick his butt. - Not like that. 
- "Headbutt." 
Sleeper hold. 
Use his own weight against him. Yeah. - Ah, get up. 
- Do what l showed you last night. Suplex. 
- Even l can fight better than that. - Mom. Triple backflip. 
- Gerti? What did you...? Why? 
- Oh, don't even get me started. 
Just wait till Mom finds out you tried to take over the world again. 
No. Please, please, please. 
D... Don't tell your mother. Please? Uh, hello. Hello, there, Mr. President. By order of the president, 
you have been temporarily disavowed. You're fired. Uh. Looks like l lost this round, but l will be back. 
Hopefully, you're on the good side next time. We will see, but... 
...you never know. Don't worry. He gets out of line, l will straighten him out. You go, Gerti. 
You tried to save us. Why? 
Because you are my family. 
Page 31/34

You know... there isn't a man on this Earth we'd ever think would be good enough for our daughter, but, um... you come pretty close. By order of the president, you are the new director of the O.S.S. Congratulations. Do they..... are they..... 
Level one. 
- No, thanks. You don't want it? 
- l am leaving the O.S.S. 
l have seen what it takes to be a top spy, and l think l can be better use to the world by just being the best... me. 
But what about all the cool gadgets? l got the best gadget right here. Use number one, a stylish bracelet. See you around? Yes. - Go ahead. Say it. What? 
- l told you so. 
Never. 
Never. 
Wait. 
Uh....... 
Thank you. You got it, boss. 
Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. 
Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. 
Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. 
Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. Carmen. 
l am not going out there. 
Oh, yes, you are. 
You're a spy, you're undercover, and you have to make them think you're a pop star. l can't sing. Who can these days? 
l can't tell you how many artists have used my Machete miracle microphone. # l can't sing # 
This will make you dance like Britney Lopez. Hey, what about me? 
This will make you play like Angus Van Santana. Cool. Now get out there and rock. # Who, what, when, where, and why # # Do l delight in # 
# What do l intend to find this time # # Run around, jumping down, 
bounce and bound and... # 
# Find another way to duck and hide # Page 32/34

What, are you surprised your gadgets work? l just realized l never put any batteries in this. Action. 
Back to one. 
Back to one. 
Ready. Yeah, but..... 
Guys, guys, we're looking 
at light on her face. Oops. 
My precious. We're nearing the 
destination zone, where all..... 
No. And then the next sentence is "The location radius where all the disappearances." Okay. We're nearing destination zone. The location 
Page 33/34
radius where all the disappearances..... Stop. Okay. We're nearing destination zone, where all the disappearances..... - Stop. l know it. l don't know it. - Juni, take wheel. What is...... What is it? 
What is it? 
Okay, what is it? 
Okay. 
Well, well, well, well, whoo. 
Man, you're not an easy man to find, you and your island of Leeke Leeke. l am Dinky. Winks, that is. Heard you had a wild place here, and, uh, well, sir, l was thinking you might be interested in a little, uh, business proposition. - You ready? Theme park. 
- Think about it. 
Families on safari, crazy critters running all over the place. 
- Hey, there, fella. Uhh. 
- Whoa. 
You can see it already, can't you? Huh? We'd be great together. What do you say?

Ha ha ha. 
He can't see me. 
You can't see me at all. 
Like, no one can touch 
John Cena. 
Sin Cara can. 
Scooby Dooby-Doo! 
1, 2, 3. 
Sin Cara wins it. 
Way to go, Scooby-Doo, 
old buddy. 
Booyah. 
Dooby-Doo. 
Congratulations. 
Page 3/38
You just beat the game 
on the hardest level ever... 
double triple beatdown extreme. But can you complete 
the victory dance? 
Oh, yeah. 
It's all yours, pal. 
You earned it. 
Perfect score! 
- Whoo-hoo! 
- Whoo-hoo! 
Hello there. 
I'm Vince McMahon, 
chairman and ceo of WWE. 
Mr. McMahon. 
We're not worthy. 
Because you beat the game 
on this level 
and executed a perfect score 
on the victory dance, 
you win a special prize. 
We did? 
You've won an all-expense paid trip to WWE city. 
Come revel in a place 
dedicated to everything WWE. 
It'll be a week of fun 
and excitement, 
culminating in ringside seats 
at WrestleMania. 
Don't miss it. 
Report to training camp 
in WWE city 
as soon as possible 
with this game disc 
as proof of your win 
to claim your prize. 
Like, WrestleMania. 
Ha ha ha! 
You gotta be kidding me. 
Think of it. 
- The fun. 
- The fans. 
The food! 
Page 4/38
We gotta go, old pal. 
Like, we just gotta go. 
We gotta go. 
Like, we just gotta go. 
It's the ultimate slamtastic 
life-affirming experience 
of a lifetime. 
It's WrestleMania. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Uh, I don't know, guys. 
It's not something 
we're really into. 
And I have a lot 
of reading to catch up on. 
Uh, no, thank you. 
Like, come on, guys. 
Scoob and I never 
ask for anything. 
Like, I can't count 
how many times 
the two of us were bait to catch some crazy mask-wearing villain. Yeah. 
I got the photos to prove it. 
Take a good look, people. 
Exhibit "a." 
Like, here's the time 
you guys made us dress 
like giant tools 
to catch the monstrous mechanic. Or as ducks to catch 
the horrific huntsman. 
Or when we had to be the cow 
to catch the crazed cowgirl 
from beyond the grave. 
Scooby-Doo almost got milked. 
It was so humiliating. 
And the pice De rsistance, 
the time we posed as 
seor Pepe Jose 
and the dancing 
hairless chihuahua don pero 
to catch the ghastly 
Page 5/38
gordito of Guadalajara. 
Yeah, the hair didn't 
even grow back in some places. Scooby was naked. 
Look at him. 
- Just look at him! 
- No, no. Ok. 
We get it. 
You win, shaggy. 
Win? Wait, what? 
I was actually thinking 
about taking a trip anyway 
to try out my new allodium 
q-36 digital slr camera 
and optical stabilizer 
zoom lens. 
Maybe I can snap 
some action-packed pictures. 
And this will give me 
an opportunity 
to explore the parallels 
between the modern world of WWE vs. Ancient warrior customs. 
Besides, it beats another 
weekend with grandpa dinkley 
and his mysterious odor problem. Scooby-Doo almost 
got milked. 
The hair didn't even grow back in some places. 
Ok, we'll go to WrestleMania. 
Whoo-hoo! 
WWE city, here we come. 
Oh, boy. 
Hee hee hee! 
Here comes the flying 
huna caruna off the top ropes. Ha ha ha! 
And it's countered 
by Scooby's patented 
corkscrew counter crunch. 
Um, exactly how many more 
play-by-play Scooby snack attacks will we have to endure 
Page 6/38
before WWE city? 
Like, we brought 
everything we had. 
Scooby and I need 
to keep our energy up 
so we can cheer like crazy 
at the main event. 
There's so many boxes 
I can't even see the luggage. 
Luggage? 
You didn't pack the luggage? 
Ruh-roh. 
Of all the food-induced, 
insane things 
you two have done, 
this absolutely takes the cake. Mmm. Cake. 
I mean it. 
Like, what's the big deal? 
We all wear the same 
outfits every single day anyway. Well, you gotta admit it, 
he does have a point. 
Hmph. 
Hey, look. 
Like, WWE city, next exit. 
Hold the phone! 
Looks like we're stuck. 
There's a car coming. 
Maybe they can help. 
Well, now, this ain't 
a good place for a breakdown. 
Can we help you kids out? 
John Cena. 
Whoa. 
Ok. Looks like you kids 
ran into some trouble. 
This ain't safe, champ. 
We gotta keep moving. 
Calm down, cookie. 
I'm just saying that it's 
dangerous out here at night, 
what with the bear trouble 
and all. 
Page 7/38
That's why ruben, 
my nephew here, and I 
have been following 
the superstars on their jogs. 
Hi. 
Well, these kids 
aren't going anywhere 
while their van is stuck. 
This shouldn't take long. 
Uh, what's he gonna do, 
lift the van out of the ditch? Scooby! Shaggy! 
Cool. 
I didn't know WWE superstars 
were so hot. 
Strong! I mean strong. 
Grr! 
Scooby, no! 
Come back! 
Scooby! Scooby! 
Scoob, stop! 
Aah! 
Scooby-Doo, 
where are you? 
Zoinks! 
A mo... a mo... monster! 
Monster? Where? 
Where? 
Oh, scoob! 
Ha ha ha! 
You had me worried, pal. 
- It's me. 
- It's you. 
Yikes! 
What are you two doing 
in my woods? 
Um, leaving. 
Cool down a bit, bayard. 
The dog and the long haired 
fella didn't mean to trespass. They're just fans 
come for the WWE. 
They all come for that. 
And the more they come, 
Page 8/38

the hungrier they make the beast. The beast? 
The beast called WWE city. 
Every day it eats up 
more and more of our land. 
But not for long, 
'cause there's a storm 
a-coming, 
and we're gonna watch it 
blow you all out of here 
like dead leaves. 
Now, get off my property. 
Oh, don't let old bayard 
spook you. 
He's not what you call 
a people person. 
Still, it's not right. 
Can I make it up to you 
by offering you some vip seats at our live event tonight? 
Would you be interested? 
Would we? 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
welcome to WWE. 
Uhh! 
Ahh! 
Uhh! 
Like, pinch me, 
I think I'm dreaming. 
Ow! 
I'm not dreaming. 
Boy, what an exciting tag team match we have here tonight. 
The big show and Alberto del Rio are up against sin Cara 
and John Cena. 
And Cena wastes no time 
delivering an elbow to big show. Whoo-hoo! Yes! 
Big show with a chop. 
And del Rio blindsides Cena. 
That was a dirty move. 
And I think the ref agrees. 
Oh, my goodness, sin Cara's up. Page 9/38

And he delivers high-flying 
justice to del Rio. 
- Whoo-hoo! 
- Heh heh heh! 
And it looks like 
the end for Cena. 
But somehow Cena reverses. 
He's got big show up. 
Oh, no! 
Look out! 
That was my favorite table. 
Del Rio's up. 
But he walks right into 
Cena's sidewalk slam. 
And the crowd goes wild. 
But wait, big show's back. 
With a picnic table? 
Where did he get a picnic table? Oh, the humanity. 
I don't see anything in the rules about the use of furniture. 
It's a show, velma. 
It's sin Cara to the rescue 
with a tilt-a-whirl. 
And it's a takedown 
of the big show. 
Oh! 
Whoo-hoo! 
- W! 
- W! 
Best move ever. 
Cena gathers his... 
Well, I can't say I'm bored. 
And here it comes. 
You can't see me. 
Cena's vintage 
5 knuckle shuffle. 
Let's go, cena! 
Let's go, cena! 
Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Yay! 
With incredible strength, 
cena takes big show to the top ropes. An avalanche. 
Attitude adjustment. 
Page 10/38

Into the cover. 
1, 2, 3! 
It's over! 
Cena for the win. 
Yeah! Yeah, man! 
Amazing, dude! 
Tonight's tag team winners, 
John cena and sin Cara. 
Oh, cena! 
My gosh, you're wonderful. 
No chance, 
that's what you got 
Welcome, fans. 
You should be excited 
because I'm about to lay on you something very heavy... 
our very own WWE 
championship belt. 
Ahh. 
Yes, it's solid gold, 
encrusted with priceless 
gems and jewels, 
but any WWE superstar will tell you it's not about the glitter. The championship belt 
represents honor, respect, 
hard work, dedication, 
the very soul of WWE. 
As you know, ever since Kane's WWE championship match was overturned, this championship belt 
has been held vacant. 
And so it shall remain 
until a true champion rises up and proves themself worthy 
this weekend in the main event at WrestleMania. 
Did you know that 
a golden ceremonial prize 
was customary at ancient games for thousands of years? 
No, velma. 
Thank you. 
Oh, it's a text from John cena, Page 11/38

thanking me personally 
for all the cheering. 
That's a keeper. 
When did you give cena 
your phone number? 
Oh, when I gave him my email, 
my home address, and my scarf size. Hey, why don't you crazy kids join us at the training camp tonight? It's something to see. 
WWE training camp? 
How'd you like sin Cara's 
convertible? 
Like, it's a real 
muscle machine. 
Here we are, guys. 
WWE's rock yard, 
where the pros train 
for greatness. 
Ahh! 
Uhh! 
Look! 
It's sergeant slaughter. 
Like, zowie! 
There's Jerry "the king" lawler. And Jimmy hart. 
Here at camp, 
we even have our own 
24-hour restaurant. 
It's like home. 
More like paradise. 
Ha ha ha! 
Is that the championship belt? That's right, carved 
into the Mountain. 
A prize set in stone 
and the dream of 
every superstar. 
Mr. sin Cara, could we 
stop for a second? 
Uhh! 
Uhh! 
Sweet. 
Way to go, ruben. 
Page 12/38
That was a nice job. 
Yeah, nice move, Ruby. 
Yeah, funktastic, baby. 
Like, wow, I didn't know 
your nephew dude 
was a superstar. 
That's what he'd like to think. I'd better get you all 
settled into your cabins. 
Up ahead on the left, sin Cara. I can't believe shaggy and Scooby left all our luggage behind. 
Now all I have 
are these two scarves. 
Which do you think 
John would like better? 
Seriously? 
Seriously. 
Be honest. 
The one on the right. 
My thoughts exactly. 
I don't understand, 
Uncle cookie. 
It's just not fair. 
You know I'm good. 
I know you know I'm good. 
Why won't you help me 
get into WWE? 
Somebody's got to put 
some sense into you. 
Do you think I built this brace because it looks good? 
All it takes is one accident 
to put you out of contention. 
Maybe I'll be luckier. 
Maybe not. 
You have to be practical. 
You should keep going 
to your computer classes. 
Computers, that's 
the ticket, Ruby. 
Poor ruben. 
I feel sorry for him. 
It's understandable. 
Page 13/38
Ruben represents the heroic male 
aspiring to the stature 
of decorated warrior. 
His journey is relatable, 
and therefore appealing to a wide audience. Velma, has it ever 
occurred to you 
that maybe WWE isn't something 
you can scientifically explain? 
Don't be silly, Daphne. 
Science and logic 
explain everything. 
Hey, like, the most 
awesome thing about WWE? 
You get all the food 
you can eat. 
Yeah. All the food. 
Big day tomorrow. 
Cookie said we get to see 
some superstars training. 
I want to grab 
some wicked action shots. 
Come on, lights out, you two. 
Okie doke, Fred. 
Sweet dreams, scoob. 
You, too, Raggy. 
All the food. 
Food. 
All the food. 
Food, food, food, food, 
food, food, food, food. 
Food, food, food, food, 
food, food, food, food. 
Huh? 
Huh? 
Huh? 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
let's get ready 
to Scooby-Doo! 
You want to take me on? 
Bring it. 
Ahh! 
Ahh! 
Uhh. 
Page 14/38
Oh, yeah? 
Prepare to become 
a Scooby snack. 
Scoob. 
Scooby-Doo. 
Hmm? 
Like, dude, what are you doing with that bear? 
Hmm? 
Aah! 
Zoinks! 
Really? 
Aah! 
Uhh! 
Ooh! 
Aah! 
Back off, ugly. 
Time to call your mama. 
Aah! Ooh! 
Aah! 
Uhh! 
Not funky. 
Shaggy! Scooby! 
Are you ok? 
Ghost... Ghost bear. 
Then it's true. 
What's true, cookie? 
The legend. 
The monster has returned 
from the grave. 
Vicious, the ghost bear 
has come to challenge us all. 
Oh. 
Well, gang, sounds like we have another mystery on our hands? 
Assault, battery, 
property damage. 
Ghost bear! 
What the heck is going on? 
And what are you kids doing 
in WWE city anyway? 
- We won a contest. 
- We won a contest. 
Don't look at me, Richards. 
Page 15/38
You sent out that memo. 
The victory dance contest. 
Oh, that's right. 
That wasn't my idea. 
Boys over in marketing 
or game development. 
One of those. 
Who can keep things straight 
with all these bear attacks 
going on? 
There have been others? 
Indeed. Several. 
All of them inside 
our buildings. 
The creature trashed the kitchen and totally obliterated 
our video game studio. 
And as quickly as it appears, 
it disappears. 
I'm telling you, it's the ghost. An evil from beyond the grave. Let's try to remain calm here. We don't want to jump 
to any crazy conclusions. 
- Mr. McMahon. 
- Mr. McMahon. 
Like, in the flesh. 
I can't believe I'm 
actually face to face 
with Vinnie Mac. 
- The boss. 
- The higher power. 
- The Mac attack. 
- The Mac daddy. 
Daddy Mac. 
Yes. Ahem. Thanks 
for that trip down memory Lane. Let me cut to the chase. 
I've been doing a little 
research on you kids. 
You're some kind of 
mystery solvers. 
We could really use 
your help here. 
Page 16/38
Gee, Mr. McMahon, 
we'd be glad to. 
My main concern is 
the championship belt. 
Not only is it worth a fortune, but WrestleMania wouldn't 
be the same without it. 
Excuse me, sir, 
but we don't need 
these kids meddling 
in security matters. 
I promise the championship belt is well guarded 24/7 
with a state-of-the-art electronic laser trip wire alarm system. 
There's no way the bear 
could get to it 
without tripping a beam 
and setting off an alarm 
that would bring in half 
my security men within seconds. I understand, Richards, 
but it couldn't hurt to have 
these kids lend a hand. 
It's what we do. 
You mind if I help? 
- Um... 
- great idea, John. 
Awesome. Because I think there's someone you should talk to. 
Sin Cara? 
He knows the legend 
of the bear better than anyone. Like, why is he hanging out 
on the roof? 
Sin Cara has a flair for drama. - Ahh. 
- Ahh. 
But does he even talk? 
He doesn't have to. 
Luckily, I speak 
masked luchador. 
I'll translate as best I can. 
The legend of the ghost bear 
Page 17/38
begins 100 years ago 
when a monstrous bear was 
part of a traveling show. 
They named him vicious. 
And for good reason. 
The creature had a mean streak a mile wide 
and twice as ugly. 
It'd never been beaten, ever. 
Till it met... 
Sin Cara Grande, 
sin Cara's great great 
great grandfather. 
He challenged the bear 
on this very spot 
long before there was 
ever a WWE city. 
The battle between 
man and bear was epic. 
The bear was a horrible, 
unstoppable beast. 
But when the match was over, 
it was the man 
standing victorious. 
The bear could not 
contain its anger. 
He unleashed his rage 
on the town. 
Many lives would have been 
lost that day 
had it not been for the brave 
luchador sin Cara Grande. 
While saving those 
innocent townfolk, 
he was injured. 
Sin Cara Grande would 
never wrestle again. 
And the bear? 
It escaped into the woods, 
disappearing into a cave 
north of town, 
never to be seen again. 
Until now. 
Sin Cara believes 
Page 18/38
the spirit of the beast 
has been stirred by 
WrestleMania itself, 
which is why the monster 
has risen from the grave 
to have its revenge. 
But fear not. 
It is now sin Cara's 
honor and duty 
to continue his great great 
great grandfather's legacy 
and protect WWE city 
at any cost. 
- Wow. 
- That's amazing, dude. 
I have half a mind 
to go out in the woods, 
find that bear, 
and rip its head off. 
I don't know, triple H, 
he's awfully tough. 
I think we should 
stick together. 
What do you think, Miz? 
Stick together. 
I can't believe 
you two are still hungry 
after the meal we had. 
This is just a late night snack. - Right, scoob? 
- Right. Helps us sleep. 
Man, if you guys' muscles 
were as big as your appetites, you'd both be superstars. 
Like, fredster, don't you 
want to join the pizzapalooza? Eh, no, thanks. 
I thought I'd patrol 
with the guards, 
maybe get a picture 
of the ghost bear. 
I'll lock the door after me. 
Like, to keep the bear out? 
To keep Scooby in. 
Page 19/38
Good idea. 
Like, don't worry, Freddy, 
the faster we eat... 
the faster we fall asleep. 
Ahh! 
Yah! 
Like, is something wrong, 
Ms. Richards? 
Indeed, there is. 
The WWE championship belt 
has been stolen. 
And we know who did it. 
Your dog. 
Uh, but that's ridiculous. 
Scooby-Doo's been in here 
with me all night. 
Isn't that right, old pal? 
That's right. 
Oh? 
I saw that. 
Uh-uh, nothing 
to see here. 
Just me in bed. 
You, sir... uh, dog, 
are a thief. 
But, Ms. Richards, Scooby 
couldn't have taken the belt. 
He's never stolen anything 
in his whole life. 
Yeah, never. 
I have proof right here. 
Last night's security footage. Take a look. 
Ooh. Uhh. 
I... I... I did steal it. 
Say it ain't true, 
Scooby-Doo. 
Hold on a second. 
Is there something strange 
about Scooby? 
You really want us 
to answer that? 
Yep, this is the 
championship belt all right. 
Page 20/38
I'd know it anywhere. 
Take it. 
And we'll be taking 
the thief with us as well. 
No! Don't let them 
take me, Raggy. 
No! 
I won't, pal. 
Hang on. 
Don't let them take me, Raggy. I'm innocent. 
Jinkies! That's it. 
Come on, we've got to work fast if we're going to save Scooby. All right, kids. 
What's going on here? 
Thanks for coming, 
Mr. McMahon. 
We've asked you all here 
to show you 
that our Scooby isn't a thief. He's just a pawn. 
Allow me. 
Here's the security video of 
Scooby as he was taking the belt. And here's the video file 
of Scooby 
doing his winning victory dance from the memory card 
of shaggy's video game. 
Yeah, that's a funkadactal move. Is there a point to any of this? Watch as we slow down 
the victory dance. 
It's the same movement. 
Scooby was programmed 
with a post-hypnotic suggestion to steal the championship belt. Like, that's why he's been 
sleep walking since he got here. Ohh. Yeah. 
And just how did the dog get 
this post-hypnotic programming? My guess is from 
Page 21/38
the video game itself. 
May I? 
I'm connecting shaggy's 
WWE video game file 
to the tron screen. 
See, someone highlighted 
every move with light flashes. Flashes which could have planted a post-hypnotic suggestion 
in Scooby's brain. 
Pbblt. Yeah, there's 
a plant in my brain. 
Nice hacks, ruben. 
That's my nephew. 
He's a computer genius. 
Listen, kids, as compelling 
as this theory might be, 
I'm still a guy that likes 
to look at the facts. 
And the fact is, he stole it. 
And he's going to jail for it. Jail? 
And it was your video game, 
so you're going with him... 
as his accomplice. 
Accomplice? I'm no accomplice! I'm not even sure 
I know what that means! 
Miss Richards, 
isn't there something we can do to prevent that? 
- No! 
- Actually, yes there is. 
- Whatever it is... 
- We'll do it. 
WWE city law states 
that anyone accused of a crime can compete in the ring for a 
chance to win their freedom. 
I have the power 
to give you that chance. 
But I have only 
one competitor left 
who is looking for a match. 
Page 22/38
- Kane! 
- Kane! 
I want another shot 
at the title. 
Looks like I'll have 
to go through you two to get it. I accept the challenge. 
Like, you know, scoob, 
I hear prison food 
isn't that bad. 
No! 
You want a chance to prove 
your innocence in the ring. 
They accept the challenge, 
Mr. McMahon. 
Miss Richards, release 
these two so they can prepare. Unless they can prove 
their innocence, 
their match with Kane 
will kick off WrestleMania 
tomorrow night. 
Like, velma, are you crazy?! 
Yeah! We can't fight Kane. 
Look, guys, 
pull yourselves together. 
I need you to buy us some time if we're going to solve this mystery, and clear Scooby's name. 
I don't know, velma, 
we only have until tomorrow 
before shaggy and Scooby 
get slaughtered. 
Hello! Thanks, Fred. 
They're going to need 
a whole lot longer than a day 
to learn how to compete 
in the ring. 
- Could you help them, cookie? - Please? 
Yeah, yeah, please, 
please, please! 
Oh-ho-ho, please, cookie! 
Eh, well, maybe I can 
Page 23/38
train 'em enough 
so they might survive... 
Ooh! 
For a few minutes. 
AJ, you want to help me here? 
Sure, cookie. 
Hi, boys. 
I heard you could use 
some practice sessions. 
Wouldn't want those 
itty bitty whiskers to get bent. Like, Scooby-Doo, 
you know, this may not 
be so bad after all. 
Aahh! 
Never underestimate a diva. 
- Let's light it up 
- light it up, light it up 
let's light it up 
let's light it up 
- light it up, light it up 
let's light it up like the night, like the diamonds I see shining in your eyes light it up, light it up 
let's light it up 
let's light up 
- light it up tonight 
let's light it up like the night, like the diamonds I see shining in your eyes in your eyes, in your eyes, 
in your eyes, in your eyes 
in your eyes, in your eyes 
something about the night 
is magic, I can't explain 
every time the sun goes down, 
I feel everything change 
Feel my temperate rage 
every night, 
a brand new page, yeah 
let's light up 
- light it up, light it up 
let's light it up 
You ok, ruben? 
No, I'm not ok. 
Page 24/38
I don't understand 
why my Uncle is willing to train shaggy and Scooby and not me. 
Just because he never won 
a championship 
doesn't mean I can't. 
Sorry. 
See, it's just because 
all my life, 
I've dreamed of being 
a WWE superstar. 
I've even come up with my own name... the bone bender. 
I got an outfit I made out 
of spandex and bones. 
Real bones I ordered 
off the Internet. 
Want to see? 
- Well, maybe later. 
- Daphne? 
You got to hide us! 
AJ's like Kane, with lipstick! Hey, gang, we got maps 
of the whole area. 
And I found the perfect place to start looking for clues about the ghost bear. Scooby, shaggy. 
Where you boys hiding? 
Like, what are we waiting for? Let's go, let's go, let's go! 
Like, wouldn't it be better 
to clear our names 
than to go, you know, 
bear hunting? 
That's just it, shaggy. 
I can't help thinking 
that whoever framed Scooby is 
somehow connected to the ghost bear. Keep it down. 
We don't want to attract bayard. You mean the hillbilly 
with the thieving raccoon? 
Yeah. Their cave 
is right on his property. 
Page 25/38
Can't say I didn't warn 'em. 
Zoinks! 
- Aroo? 
- Run! 
Run! 
Scoob! 
Aah! 
Whoo-hoo-hoo-ah! 
Oh! Ooh, hoo, whoa-ho! 
- Aah! 
- Huh?! 
Like, that was amazing! 
Cen-amazing! 
How'd you know where we were? 
- Daphne texted me. 
- Mmm. 
Naturally. 
What's going on? 
Hillbilly hospitality. 
We should keep moving. 
Come on, 
I'll explain on the way. 
This is it, guys. 
Bear cave. 
Come on, follow me. 
Now, that's rich. 
Those dummies 
just walked into a trap 
that's better 
than any I could make. 
Bet you that was 
the original bear. 
He doesn't look so vicious now. How long do you think 
he's been there? 
Who cares, as long 
as he stays there. 
Yeah! 
Like, man, 
what is this crazy place? 
My guess? The lair 
of the ghost bear. 
Like, he has a lot of junk 
for a ghost... or a bear. 
Page 26/38
Not junk. 
Clues! 
What are those? 
Books on hypnotism. 
Hypnotic techniques 
and subliminal hypnosis. 
- Jackpot! 
- Ohh! 
I think we just found 
our first piece of evidence 
to get you guys 
off the hook with Kane. 
Evidence! Whoo-hoo-hoo! 
We love evidence. 
- Mwah! 
- Hey, gang. 
Check this out. 
Schematics for EMP. 
What's an EMP? 
What's a schematic? 
An EMP 
is an electromagnetic pulse. 
It's a device that can destroy electronics within its range. 
Urghh! 
Look what I found. 
This calendar has the date 
for WrestleMania circled in red. R.I.P. WWE. 
Fred! 
Evidence photos, velma. 
Can't have an investigation 
without evidence photos. 
So someone thinks they're going to knock the lights out on WrestleMania? Not on my watch! 
John! 
Gh-gh-ghost bear! 
Run! 
Yikes! 
Ohh! 
Whoa! 
Ohhh! 
Ah-ah-aaah! 
Page 27/38

Huh?! 
We're right back 
where we started! 
Jinkies! 
And so's the ghost bear! 
Where are the boys?! 
We got to get the evidence! 
Don't worry, shaggy. 
I still have the photos. 
Yeah! 
No! 
- Yoinks! 
- Ahh! 
Guys, hold on to something. 
Aah... ohh? 
Ohh! 
Ah. Huh? 
Boom! 
Epic! 
Ah, enough already! 
Hey! Over there! 
Huh? 
Hey! What do you know? 
The caves are connected 
directly to the storm drains 
under WWE city. 
Giving that ghost bear 
full access at any time. 
So you see, Richards, 
that's how the ghost bear 
gets in and out of so many 
places so quickly. 
And we have reason to believe that whoever's behind these bear attacks, has planted an EMP device 
right here in the stadium. 
He could shut down 
the whole place 
right in the middle 
of WrestleMania. 
We shouldn't take any risks. 
We'll have to cancel the show. We can't cancel WrestleMania! 
That's like canceling Christmas. Page 28/38

Not to mention my career. 
Besides, what could anyone gain but shutting off the lights? 
Not only the lights, 
but the TV cameras, too. 
There'd be no show. 
People would panic 
in the pitch black. 
They'd get hurt! 
You're right, sin Cara. 
It would tarnish 
the entire legacy of WWE. 
Listen. I'll have my men 
guard the stadium's 
generators 24/7. 
They'll check every square inch of the building 
right before the show. 
No one's going to get away 
with anything under my watch. 
One way or another, 
WrestleMania goes on. 
If the object of the EMP 
is to create chaos, 
you can bet that ghost bear is not going to be far away when it happens. I think we all know 
what we need to do. 
Run away? 
Nope. We've got to turn 
WrestleMania into a trap. 
A big bear trap. 
Whatever you plan, Fred, 
count me in. 
Come on, then. 
We don't have much time. 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
announcing a new match 
for tonight's event. 
Kane vs. Skinny man 
and dead meat. 
Like, do you think maybe the 
gang has solved the mystery yet? Because there's no mysteries 
Page 29/38
to where we're going. 
Yeah. To the hospital. 
No. The morgue! 
Come on, guys, 
you got to have confidence. 
You have to get up there 
and give it your all! 
If you don't hold back; 
If you battle with your heart and soul, if you give everything 
you've got, 
then you'll not only 
survive this, you could win! 
Nice knowin' ya. 
Hey, uh... 
Break a leg, you two. 
Ooh! If we're lucky. 
Whoo-hoo! 
Let the games begin! 
Bring on the pain train! 
Whoo! 
This is going to be great! 
Yeah! 
So awesome! 
Everybody in position? 
Check. 
Sin Cara's ready. 
And so am I. 
Triple H? 
Ready out here. 
No chance 
that's what you got 
Welcome to WrestleMania! 
Allow me to show you 
why we're all here... 
bring it up. 
The WWE championship belt. 
The superstar who wins 
tonight's main event 
will be the new WWE champion. 
Jinkies! That's it. Fred, 
I know where the electromagnetic pulse device is. 
Tonight's first match 
Page 30/38
is a big one, folks. 
We have the newcomers, 
skinny man and dead meat. 
- Ohh! 
- Ohh! 
They'll be facing 
the meanest competitor 
in and out of the ring. 
Back for revenge, 
determined to destroy anyone 
between him and the title. 
I give you the big, red monster. Kane! 
This is a last man 
standing match. 
The superstar who's unable 
to answer a ten count 
after being knocked down 
is declared the loser. 
Come on, scoob, we got... 
we got to keep it together! 
Oh... oh... K! 
After Kane is finished 
with skinny man and dead meat, we'll be scraping them 
off the mat with a spatula. 
And there's the bell. 
Kane explodes across the ring. Oh! There goes any chance 
for a fair match. 
Skinny man and dead meat... 
slam into the big red monster. Certainly that blow 
can only increase Kane's fury. Ohh! 
Miss Richards, you have to open the safe and check the championship belt! Are you crazy? Look, 
I checked the entire stadium 
for your electro-whatumacalit. It's not here! 
It's right there. 
Impossible. 
If only I had a magnet 
Page 31/38
to prove it. 
Wow! Where did you get that? 
Luchadores... always 
ready for anything. 
Ok. Miss Richards, 
this magnet will prove 
that your championship belt 
isn't gold. 
Because if it sticks... 
Then it's made of iron 
and it's a fake. 
Caught in the clenches of Kane, the newcomers are done for. 
Whoa! 
The bounce out of the ring 
offers skinny man and dead meat a chance for escape... 
but look at this! 
Kane has just taken 
the match under the ring. 
It's bedlam down below! 
- Huh?! 
- Ahh! 
Not again! 
Somebody get me another desk 
out here, please. 
Ha ha! 
Jinkies! The EMP 
is about to go off. 
We'll never get it 
far enough away. 
The arena power generator 
is right below us. 
I've got to warn everyone. 
I have an idea. 
Hold this and let go when I say. Right... Ok. 
Now! 
Eeh! 
That wasn't supposed to happen. Huh? Whoa! 
Huh? What's going on? 
What happened? 
What happened to the TV?! 
Page 32/38
Oh, man, this is awful! 
Who turned out the lights? 
Ok, guys, it's here. 
The fans are starting to panic. Plan B. Here we go. 
Whoo-hoo! Nice throw! 
We can see! 
Let there be light! 
Funkadelic. 
Part of the show? 
That was just part 
of the show! I was worried. 
- I'm fine now. 
- I'm ok! 
Scooby! You can do it. 
You know all the right moves. 
- I do? 
- Yeah! 
From the video game. 
I trust the massive power 
of your superstar-tastic 
dance moves. 
Just pretend you're playing 
the video game. 
I can do this. 
I can do this! 
That a boy, scoob! 
Huh?! 
Whoa! 
Ghost bear sighted. 
Good. He's here. 
Just like we thought he'd be. 
The lights are starting to go. Don't worry... Fred's on it. 
Triple H. 
Ok, guys, 
hit the generators. 
Huh? 
After a mysterious blackout, 
we're somehow back on the air. Hey! Dead meat's not dead yet. Wow, look at that doggy move. 
Go, dead meat! 
Freddy, go! 
Page 33/38
Plan C. 
Hey, smokey! 
Where's the fire? 
Prepare to face the wrath 
of the bone bender! 
Is that a bear?! 
Like, zoinks! 
Is that ruben? 
Ruben, no! 
Whoa-oh-oh! 
Ohhh! 
I don't believe it, folks. 
Kane has been flattened, 
and a new competitor has entered the ring. But wait! Someone 
has activated the cage. 
Sin Cara and John cena 
are leaping into the ring. 
It's a cage match! 
Like, we're all doomed! 
Don't worry, shaggy. 
I'll protect you. 
The mysterious new competitor 
attacks the bear from behind, 
creating a distraction 
for cena to make a move. 
But this powerful creature 
turns the tables on them both. 
Now sin Cara stands alone. 
The fearless luchador attacks. 
He glides around the bear 
like lightning. 
The bear 
can't even touch sin Cara. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I haven't seen moves like this in the ring before. Sin Cara delivers 
a stunning blow to the bear 
while John cena 
recovers on the mat. 
He's going after the bear. 
Cena is lifting the bear 
over his head. 
And the bear is down. 
Page 34/38
- Yeah! 
- Yay! 
Yes! 
What's that, bear, what's that? You can't see me! 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
here it is. 
Cena's vintage 
five knuckle shuffle. 
It's lights out 
for this big, bad bear. 
This match is over. 
Yay! Yay! 
Cena and sin Cara 
going for a tandem pin. 
Impossible! 
Huh? 
Ooh-hoo-hoo! 
Scooby-Doo, where are you?! 
This looks bad for skinny man. But wait, 
what is dead meat up to? 
Dead meat has revived Kane. 
The big, red monster has risen. Never before have we seen 
a stand-off like this. 
It's monster vs. Monster 
inside the cage at WrestleMania. Who will survive 
this supernatural match-up? 
Who will be victorious 
in this paranormal pandemonium? Kane drives the bear back 
with a stunning blow. 
The bear hits the mat. 
Kane pins down its leg. 
A new competitor, 
John cena and sin Cara 
pile onto the powerful creature, but they can 
barely hold it down. 
Scooby-Doo, it's up to you! 
Only dead meat can tip 
the balance now. 
Page 35/38

Can he do it? 
Can dead meat save the day? 
Scooby Doobie Doo! 
Dead meat just delivered 
a gut-wrenching belly bomb 
and flattened the ring 
and exploded the cage! 
The dust is clearing now. 
The bear is out cold. 
Dead meat wins it! 
Whoo! 
Dead meat! 
That bear is toast! 
You ok, Velm? 
This... Is... Awesome! 
Whoo-hoo! 
Now let's see 
who this ghost bear really is. - Cookie?! 
- Cookie?! 
- Cookie?! 
- Uncle cookie! 
Why? 
WWE is your life. 
WWE was his life, 
but sadly, your Uncle cookie 
never got the glory... 
And his injury 
put him out of the spotlight. 
Permanently. 
He started to truly resent WWE because he knew he could 
never be the champion 
he always dreamed of being. 
That resentment grew into 
hatred over the years, 
as he trained others to be 
what he could not. 
That's when he developed 
his plan for revenge. 
But that wouldn't be enough. 
He needed a pawn to steal 
the championship belt. 
That's when he devised the idea Page 36/38

of hacking into a video game 
and placing post-hypnotic 
suggestions into it. 
That game would become 
part of a contest, 
which cookie set up with fake 
emails he sent throughout WWE. 
That's why he used the bear to 
attack your video game studio. 
To cover his tracks. 
The contest assured 
that only the most skilled pawn 
would arrive at WWE city 
to aid in the theft. 
Cookie then used flashing lights to activate Scooby's post-hypnotic programming. When cookie identified the belt in Scooby's bed as the championship belt, he was lying. 
He'd already switched them. 
With Scooby taking the blame, 
cookie was free to carry out 
his ultimate plan. 
Which was to turn out the lights, 
and with the help of the bear, 
create so much 
panic and injury... 
That WrestleMania 
would be completely ruined 
and WWE would never recover. 
But thanks to Fred here, 
we got the lights back on pretty quick. Good work! 
Ah, um, thanks. 
And the real championship 
belt, where is it now? 
Elementary, 
my dear Mr. McMahon. 
Cookie's wearing it. 
Sorry, cookie. 
But the championship belt isn't 
for cheaters, it's for champions. 
Good call, 
hiring these kids, sir. 
Page 37/38
I thought they might 
come in handy. 
Just get cookie out of here! 
Yes, sir, will do, sir, you bet. A championship belt was the 
icing on the cake, Mr. McMahon. Cookie could live off its golden jewels for the rest of his life. Boo! 
And I would have 
gotten away with it, too, 
if it weren't 
for you meddling kids 
and your giant, crazy dog! 
I guess after what 
my Uncle's done, 
you won't be wanting me 
around anymore. 
- Not so, Ruby. 
- You're one of us now. 
You got the funk, son! 
That's right, ruben. You've shown a superstar spirit in the ring, and at the computer. 
You've earned a place with us 
in whatever you want to do. 
The choice is yours. 
Thanks, Mr. McMahon. 
Now that we have 
the real championship belt, 
it needs to be awarded 
to true champions. 
And after what I've seen 
tonight, they're right here. 
Skinny man and dead meat! 
- Really? 
- Huh? 
Well done. 
Scooby-Doo! 
Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo! 
Scooby-Doo! 
Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo! 
Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo! 
Scooby Doobie Doo! 


Sorry! 
Hey, wait for me! 
Hold the boat! 
I'm coming! 
Noah! Mr. The Ark! I'm here. 
Barely made it. I thought 
you were leaving without... 
Gee, Mr. Noah, sir... 
...l'm gonna come too. 
What are you, anyway? 
Good question. 
Now technically speaking... 
...let's say, put me down 
as a whatever. 
What do you mean? What is your species? I don't know. 
I guess there's only one of me. Then you are doomed! 
Wait. Wait! 
Yes, sir? 
You may need this. 
But, but... 
I don't want to be alone! 
No, I don't want to be alone. 
I don't wanna be alone! 
You're not alone. 
Who said that? 
Gee, I don't know. Maybe it's the rat who's hanging out of the window! Rizzo? 
No, it's Santa, 
but I forgot my reindeer. 
- I'm sorry, Rizzo. 
- Yeah, right. 
Boy. 
I had that weird dream again. 
The one with the goat and the dwarf and the jar of peanut butter? 
It was the one where... 
Forget it. You wouldn't understand. I'd understand. 
Come on, we're roommates. 
I'm here for you, man. 
Okay. It's the one where 
Page 2/37
I'm talking to this Noah guy... ...and he won't let me on his boat because I'm all... 
...alone. 
Good night, Rizzo. 
Morning. 
What? Hey, man! 
I do it all for you, ladies. 
And scrunch. 
Scrunch it. And right. And left. And suck in those tummies, ladies. Great. Way to get down 
with your bad selves. 
- Pass the bagel. 
- Good morning, Rowlf. 
Good morning, Bob. 
- Good morning, everyone. 
- Morning. 
Hello, little people. 
What an absolutely splendid day! How are you, Piggy? 
Late. I start my fabulous 
new job today. 
We megastar TVjournalists 
have to be punctual, you know. - TVjournalist? 
- Gotta run. Bye, Kermie. 
Kissie, kissie. 
- Is breakfast over? 
- No, why? 
Because I think the bacon just ran out. The raspberry flapovers 
will be out in a moment. 
Uncle Kermit, what will you do now that you're on vacation? 
Robin, once I get 
those housepainters started... ...l'm gonna kick back and relax. - When will you fix the oven, okay? - What's wrong with it? 
That. 
Yurski burski popovers kaboofed. I'll put it on the top of my list. There is a menu correction, okay. 
Page 3/37
We will now be serving 
bologna sandwiches. 
But no bread. 
I'm gone. 
Hey, Gonzo, aren't you performing at that bar mitzvah today? 
Electric Mayhem's covering for me. Shalom. 
Oy! 
But you never miss the chance to get shot out of a cannon. Something wrong? It's just that I'm sick and tired of being a one-of-a-kind freak, that's all. Gonzo, you are not 
a one-of-a-kind freak. You're a... A whatever? 
- Yeah. 
- You see? 
See what I mean? I don't even know where I came from orwho I am. 
Yo, Kerm. 
Were you waiting for some painters? - They're driving away. 
- What? 
Animal bit one of them. 
Wait, guys! 
Don't let them go! 
You know what you are? 
Distinct. 
Hey, wait, guys! He didn't mean it! He's just a musician! 
Distinct, huh? 
More like extinct. 
"Watch the sky"? 
Rizzo, come here. I think my 
Kap'n Alphabet is sending me a message. I had some guacamole last night, and it's still speaking to me. 
No, really. Look, look. 
I'm not kidding. 
Well, it was there just a second ago. I swear, Rizzo. 
It said, "Watch the sky." 
Are you sure it didn't say, 
Page 4/37
"You need help"? 
Maybe you and your cereal 
want to be alone. 
Oh, boy. 
My bologna has a first name 
It's O-S-C-A-R 
Cool. 
"R U there"? 
C.O.V.N.E.T. 
Top secret national security facility. 
Mission: 
Investigate threat 
of extraterrestrial attack... 
... cleverly disguised 
as a cement factory. 
General Luft, welcome. 
I'm on a schedule. 
What have you got? 
Hard evidence. 
We finally got them. 
- Rentro. 
- Yes, sir? 
The remote. 
The goat? 
The remote. 
I thought he said, "The goat." Overthe past few months... 
...we have received some 
unusual communications. 
Communications, sir, 
that are not of this Earth. 
- Really? 
- Incoming. 
Sorry about that, general. 
Here's your remote. 
Thank you, Rentro. 
We believe that aliens are using a contact on Earth... 
...to plan their invasion. 
Now, this same message, "R U there"... ...has appeared all overthe world. We've been lucky enough to capture these instances on film. 
Page 5/37
The pyramids at Giza. 
Stonehenge. 
Okay, now, this one says... 
..."R U three," but we believe that to be a simple spelling error. This could be vandalism, 
a practical joke. 
Now, you see that? 
That's what I said, general. 
These photos are... 
I'll just be over here, then. 
Right this way, general. 
When I plotted 
these anomalies sequentially... ...a pattern emerged. 
A spiral. 
Do you see the spiral? 
Sir, they are out there. 
They are coming here. 
Do you have any idea 
what you have here, Singer? 
I have an inkling. 
Bubkes. 
- Bubkes... 
- Good day. 
But, sir, we have to take action now. I hired you to find me an alien. And you bring me doctored photos and a spiral. 
You are on thin ice, boy. 
I gotta hand it to you, sir. 
I thought your presentation 
was just wonderful. 
Whoop, there it is. 
Roberta. Dolores. 
Shannanay! 
What should I do with the bills? - Just leave them inside. 
- All right. 
Gonzo, do you want your new issue of Insanity Fair?. 
No, I'll get it later. 
What is he doing up there? 
His breakfast cereal told him 
Page 6/37
to sit on the roof. 
Talk about whole-grain and nuts! Cool! 
Cool! 
This could be painful. 
It is. It is! 
Greetings, Mr. Gonzo. Greetings! What are you guys? Space fish? 
We are cosmic knowledge fish. 
We know many, many things. 
- Would you like some tea? 
- No, thanks. 
Mr. Gonzo, your people have been trying to reach you. 
My people? Are they fish too? 
We're not the same as you. 
We are highly evolved beings. 
Now, if... 
What was I saying? 
My people. 
- Oh, yes. 
- Excellent. 
Mow the lawn if you wish to 
find what you seek. 
I should mow the lawn? 
A lawn that is cut 
in your own words, Gonzo. 
- A message that can be seen from space. - Space! 
So trim it well. 
Goodbye, Gonzo. 
And may the fish be with you. 
Thanks, guys, forthe cosmic knowledge. Goodbye, Mr. Gonzo. 
That's it! 
Come on, Rizzo. Time to bet, okay. All right, prawn cracker. 
I'll see your Maryland crab cakes... ...and I'll raise you 
a 1958 cheddar cheese... 
...never been sniffed. 
- Crab cakes and cheese? 
- Can't beat that. 
Hey, guys! 
Page 7/37
The cosmic fish have spoken to me. I'm from outer space! 
Yeah, yeah, that's great. 
- Pepe, are you in or out? 
- I'm in. 
I'm an alien! 
You been tap-dancing 
on your barbecue? 
No, no, Rizzo. I'm just fine. 
My cards! 
Somebody get a fire extinguisher! Are you sure you're okay? 
Absolutely. But I have to respond. Gotta make contact. 
Where's he going? 
Who cares? Flying saucer, maybe. Dos deuces. 
The prawn crackerwins. 
Pair of twos! I swear, 
I had four aces. I really did. You got to know when to hold it Know when to fold it 
Just a few things fortoday, 
sir. 
Here's a winner. 
Your Platinum Buns workout tape. And let's see... 
That new satellite photo is here... ...my Captain Kangaroo pajamas... - What? 
What satellite photo? 
"I am here." 
Mowed in the lawn. 
Who did this? 
This is not good. 
Poor guy. He's hallucinating. 
Getting weird messages. 
Hearing things. 
He listens to voices 
and does what they say. 
Hold your horseshoes. 
I think I've got an idea. 
You're scary. 
I have to call Luft. 
Page 8/37
Wait. Careful. 
Careful. 
Baby steps. 
Baby steps. 
We need more evidence. 
More evidence. 
Remember, we're just watching. Watching. 
- And waiting. 
- Waiting. 
Build it and we will come. 
Build what? 
Build a Jacuzzi... 
...and we will come, okay. 
I'm up. I'm up. 
Must build Jacuzzi. 
- Well done, pal. 
- Gracias, amigo. 
Put a little more paprika 
on those, okay? Thank you. 
Well, that's everything. 
- He built it. 
- And we came! 
Remember, I built this new 
Jacuzzi for my alien family... ...so no eating in the spa. 
We gotta tell him the truth, Pepe. You tell him... 
...and I will smack you. 
I will smack you like 
a bad, bad donkey, okay. 
- Sal. 
- Yeah, Johnny. 
There are no cannolis. 
Yeah, but try this cake. 
This is a beauty. 
That is nice. Would you... 
Gonzo! 
Go easy on the buffet, fellas. I just want... 
Who cut the cake? Who cut the cake? - Who cut it? 
- Look at that. 
- Who cut this cake? 
Page 9/37
- That's awful. They would've done... I can't believe it. The guests of honor aren't even here yet. Hey, great party! 
I just wish they'd get here. 
Hey, you! Did you cut Gonzo's cake? I wonder if there is life 
on other planets. 
What do you care? 
You don't have a life on this planet. Are you ready? 
The Galaxy Channel presents... ...UFO Mania Live, with 
close-encounter expert Shelley Snipes. Hello, I'mShelley Snipes. 
Coming up on UFO Mania Live... ... I'll be taking a hard look 
at some compelling new data. 
Have you seen something in the sky but were afraid to talk about it? I don't understand why 
they didn't show up. 
Well, perhaps we can be of assistance. I think we can help you contact your alien brethren... 
...by boosting your newly enhanced conductivity. 
Okay, Beakie. Let her rip. 
Wait a minute. 
I think I'm picking up a signal. If you've had contact 
with an alien... 
... or if you are an alien 
and want to tell your story... ... write to us or come to our studio. Come to our studio 
at 6577 Broadcast Lane now. 
The mother ship is calling me home! Thanks, guys. 
The mother ship! It worked. 
The mother ship! 
Good, good, good. Beaker? 
You said you going to tell him, okay. The Jacuzzi thing was your idea, 
Page 10/37
and you have to tell him. 
S, I will tell him, okay. 
- They're calling me! 
- Here he comes. 
I can't talk now, guys. 
- You should've told him. 
- I wasn't supposed to! 
- You said you'd tell him. 
- I said, you! 
Hi, guys. I'm here. 
Just leave the tractor here 
in front, okay? 
And that's the way it is. 
This is Miss Piggy saying 
good night and have a great... 
Where's my coffee? 
I'm coming! Coming! 
- I'll take one. 
- In a minute. 
Light, no sugar. 
Shelley's stuck at the airport. 
She won't make it on time. 
Okay, I am not gonna panic. 
Who am I kidding? Yes, I am. 
No, I'm not. 
Okay, I'm panicking. Who can we 
possibly get at the last minute? Who? Cappuccino? 
Stand by, everybody. 
Roll tape, please. 
And cue I.D. 
We're on in five... four... three... two... Look! It's Piggy's new show. 
Read! Read! 
"Hello again. I'm Shelley Snipes." Today on UFO Mania: Flying saucers... ...and their extraterrestrial pilots. - Wish I could find my pants. 
- You should come to see this. 
"I'msure you've often wondered... ... What might those alien creatures look like?" 
People of Earth, do not be alarmed. My message will be brief. 
Page 11/37
I am Gonzo. 
I don't have a Gonzo. 
There seems to be some mistake. Dang! 
You better get down there, Kerm. Relax. No one is going anywhere, okay? You see, I was contacted through my breakfast cereal... 
... and it was confirmed 
by the cosmic fish... 
... that I amfromouter space. 
So you wanna go now 
orwait forthe commercial? 
Now. Come on. 
What are you doing here? 
I'm making contact. 
What are you doing? 
Interview him. 
I'm interviewing... 
I'm interviewing you! 
Great! What would you like to know? The whole tearful tale 
of your inner struggle, Gonzo. I want my people to know I've received their messages, and my response is... ... I am here. 
"I am here." 
Bingo. 
I'mat 44 Bronson Lane, 
and I can't wait to meet you. 
And I can't wait to meet you. 
Me too. He's very charismatic, don't you think? 
Freeze that! 
- I want him here and I want him now. - Yes, sir. 
So you're ourfancy little landscaper. We're gonna take a break. 
We are going to pause, 
and we'll be back with Gonzo... ...the geek who fell to Earth... ...with moi, Miss... 
- And we're out. 
Ninety seconds, folks. 
Page 12/37
Now that is TV. 
The phones are lighting up like Vegas. What power! You're a hit! 
Thank you. 
Not you. Him. 
- Me? 
- You've got it. 
Sure wish we could find a cure. What's going on? 
Listen, aren't you taking 
this alien thing a little too far? Kermit, I realize that it may be hard for you to accept me as an alien... ...but I didn't choose to be one. Well, I've always had 
alien tendencies. 
This just makes sense. 
Beautiful, big G. 
- I see a follow-up episode here. - Me too. 
"The Alien In My Life." 
A Miss Piggy special report. 
What? You're the coffee pig. 
Kermit, he's such a joker. 
We'll take this from here. 
We're with the Society for 
the Prevention of Cruelty to Aliens. We feel your pain. 
They feel my pain. 
I got a paper cut that's a doozy. You feel my pain too? 
Can you help me make contact 
with my alien tribe? 
Yes, we can, Gonzo. 
Somebody believes me. 
Come on, fellas. 
Take me to my leader. 
I don't like the look of them. This rat smells a rat. 
The limo's right this way. 
Did he say limo? 
Wait, I'm his translator. 
Wait! 
You know this Gonzo, right? 
Page 13/37
- If the price is right. 
- The price? 
Look. 
I deliver Gonzo's exclusive 
live story, okay... 
...if you make moi 
your new anchorwoman. 
We're back in 15 seconds. 
- What about Shelley? 
- Shelley's smelly! 
- Yes, yes! Go. 
- All right! 
Excuse me. 
Excuse me. Hey, studmuffin, hold it. I'll deal with her. 
You'll deal with moi. 
Look, chumpo, I'm just trying to get a story. 
How about this story? 
It's about a big bad wolf 
and a little pig. 
No, that's three pigs, okay? 
Not in this version. 
Wait a minute. You're not part of that alien-protection agency. 
Who are you? 
Where are you taking Gonzo? 
I'm impressed. 
Black belt, third degree. 
Platinum belt, 
with an unlimited line of credit. I like this party. 
Tough guy. Tough guy! 
Come on. Show me! 
Look! Cindy Crawford. 
Where have you been all my life? Is that all you got? 
Is that all you got? 
Not the noogie! 
Mama! 
What the hey? 
Gonzo! Gonzo! Gonzo! 
There are no aliens here. 
Only good, old-fashioned, 
Page 14/37

hard-working Americans. 
Good grief. 
Now get off my Kentucky bluegrass. Look! It's a little green man. Excuse me, but what are 
all you people doing here? 
We were drawn here by the alien. That's all I know. 
So let me get this straight now. This government agency, C.O.V.N.E.T., has abducted Gonzo... 
...and taken him 
to its top-secret facility? 
Yes, Miss Piggy. 
Thank you. 
You've been most helpful. 
At last! A real story. 
Intrigue, danger, new outfits. And it's mine, mine, mine! 
All mine! 
Come on, please. You think 
Ted Koppel never gets excited? So this is the carthat 
takes us to the limo, right? 
Somebody should look 
at those shocks. 
At least they carried our stuff. Don't hold your breath for a tip. As ambassador of Earth... 
...I welcome you. 
I'm Edgar... 
...but I want you to call me Ed. That's Ed. 
And it's an honor 
to meet you, Mr. Gonzo. 
Yeah. Me too. 
Hors d'oeuvres! 
Please... 
...won't you sit? 
Thanks. 
Careful, careful. 
You'll get gas. 
So when do we begin, Ed? 
I'm very excited about all this. Page 15/37

Me too, my friend. 
Me too. 
Kermie! 
Kermie! Everybody! 
Come here. 
Listen, everyone, listen. 
I've got great news! 
Gonzo has been kidnapped 
by the government... 
...and it could be 
a life-threatening situation! 
How can that be great news? 
Because... 
...l've got the story! 
I've got the story! 
I need to change. Something that says, "Journalistic integrity." - I've gotta pee. 
- Oh, brother! 
What are we gonna do? 
Okay, guys, it's up to us. 
We have to save Gonzo from 
a whole army of government agents. Well, I have a joke book. 
Drumsticks! Drumsticks! 
I have some loose Jell-O, okay. Okay. Well, that settles that. In circumstances like this, 
there's only one place to turn. - What do you got, Bunsen? 
- There you are. 
Well, here at Muppet Labs, 
we've come up with many devices... ...that should aid you 
in your covert operations. 
This seemingly ordinary 
rubber ducky... 
...actually contains 
invisibility spray. 
However, the effect is, 
sadly, temporary. 
The old rubber-ducky-with 
invisibility-spray trick. Check. And, Beaker, if you would. 
Page 16/37
Here is something that 
we're very excited about. 
"Door in a jar"? 
That's absolutely right, Beakie. All you do is open up the jar... ...fling the contents 
onto the wall, and poof! 
Instant door. 
What is this? 
A secret communication device? That's Scotch tape. 
Useful if something tears. 
And what do you have for moi?. Well, Miss Piggy, for you 
we have Muppet Labs Mind Mist. Simply spray it on the subject... ...and they will obey 
your every command. 
I doubt I'll need any. 
Okay, guys, let's go get Gonzo. - Vmonos! 
- Come on. 
We'll find him, okay. 
I've been looking for 
something like you... 
...all my life. 
And now, at last, my search... ...has come to an end. 
May I? 
Before you answer, 
you better be clear... 
...on the final destination 
of that finger. 
Thanks. 
No nostrils. 
How do you smell? 
Awful. Trust me, I'm his roommate. That's a killer! 
Don't... 
...laugh... 
...at me! 
I hope I'm not imposing, but I thought you were just great on TV. Could I get your autograph? 
Page 17/37
It's not a good time. 
This is probably not a good time. Forgive me my earthly manners. But do you have any idea 
what it's like... 
...to be laughed at? 
Sure, I do. 
To be called names like "wacko"? And "freak boy"? 
And paranoid delusional psychopath? Got me there. 
To feel... 
...completely alone 
in this world? 
I think we're starting to get 
the general idea there, Ed. 
It's wrestling legend 
Hollywood Hulk Hogan?! 
Have the rat sent down 
to Dr. Tuckerfor some tests. 
But I haven't studied. 
I don't even have a number-two pencil! This is for all my NWO-ites out there. I will continue to dominate wrestling. I'll make your back crack, your knees 
freeze and your liver quiver. 
I will continue to put so much pain on you, you'll become my "painiac." Hollywood. 
Would you mind? The rat. 
Where you going with my friend? What will yourfans think? 
Hey, what you gonna to do? 
I'm a bad guy now. 
Gonzo, help me! 
He's going to be fine. 
How you doing? I'm Bubba. 
Rizzo. Nice to meet you. 
Nice to meet you. 
How'd you like to meet the boys? Sure. 
Up there, that's Fast Eddie, 
harmonica extraordinaire. 
- How you doing, Ed? 
Page 18/37

- I ain't dead. 
Over here's Troy. 
This back here, that's Shakes. Hi. How you doing? Welcome. 
They're doing a new 
caffeine substitute on him. 
That's the Birdman. 
Where are you? Gladys? 
He don't bother nobody. 
He's been here forever. 
Gladys! Come on, 
the guys are watching. 
He just likes to hang out 
with his birds. 
So that about does it for all 
of us here at Medical Research. Medical Research? 
But that would mean we're... 
...lab rats! 
Gonzo, get me out of here! 
Now, Mr. Gonzo. 
What can you tell me about these? They really have been looking for me. - And they are coming to Earth? - I don't know. 
- How many are there? 
- I don't know. 
When will they be here? 
And don't you dare tell me... 
...that you don't know. 
I know not? 
But maybe I could find out? 
Could you? 
Well! 
Okay, then. 
I'll keep in touch. Thanks. 
So back to the limo? 
It's a shame, really. 
I really need that information. So I'm afraid 
we'll have to perform... 
...an invasive quadra-lobal 
brain probe on you... 
...and pluck it from your head. Page 19/37

The information? 
No, your brain. Take him away. My brain? 
But just a second. I... 
- Where are you taking me? 
- Get General Luft. 
I need my brain. 
Tell me again. 
Why are we doing this? 
To save Gonzo. 
Right. 
Because Gonzo's one of us. 
No matterwhat happens, no matter what obstacles we face... 
...we neverforget one of our own. I love it when you take charge. We left Bunsen and Beaker 
back at the gas station. 
From now on, 
no matterwhat happens... 
...we neverforget one of our own. That's right. 
Cheese Twiddle? 
Is this movie time or something? So you're the new guy. 
From this moment on, if I say 
you're hungry, you eat. 
If I say you're sleepy... 
I eat? 
Oh, you shouldn't have... 
Well, well, well. 
We got a funny boy here. 
- Is that bad? 
- Very bad. 
It looks like funny boy's 
going to the maze. 
Since we don't want funny boy 
to get lonely... 
...you'll all do time 
in the maze. 
I'm sorry. 
See, no one's ever escaped 
from the maze, funny boy. 
And even if you did, 
Page 20/37
it's fourfeet to the ground... ...twelve feet to the door 
and fourfeet to the doorknob. 
- That's 18 feet. 
- Twenty. 
Funny thing about doorknobs: 
Rats can't turn them. 
No opposable thumb. 
This is ridiculous! 
Hey, Riz, watch out 
forthem red circles. 
What's wrong with the red... 
Nobody ever listens. 
Red circles. Right. 
Now let me see. 
Cheese, rat poison. 
Cheese, rat poison. 
What do you guys think, I'm crazy? This is a no-brainer. 
This ain't so bad. 
A little breezy. Oh, boy. 
Auntie Em, it's a twister! 
This is just like 
one of those carny rides. 
You just gotta hang on, and at the end I get some cotton candy. I'm gonna hurl! 
You're just trying 
to play mind games here. 
But I know the cheese is safe... ...because you think I'm going 
forthe poison, right? 
Room service. 
Hey there, little fella. 
How you doing? 
While they're warming up the brain sucker, I brought you a sandwich. And I cut off the crusts there for you. There you go. 
Gee, that's nice. Thanks. 
Anything for a celebrity. 
Do you like jalapeos? 
Sure. 
Jalapeos 
Page 21/37
Hey, mopey! 
- Who said that? 
- I did. 
But you're just a sandwich. 
I'm channeling my voice through this sandwich to deliverthis message. Great! What's the message? 
We arrive at midnight tonight. Really? And do all of you 
look like sandwiches? 
- Forget about the sandwich! 
- I'm sorry. 
Jalapeos, jalapeos 
Getting my friend some jalapeos So here's the plan: 
We're landing at your house. 
No, no, wait. 
Those guys know where I live. 
And they're not the best 
examples of Earthlings. 
Gosh, where else can we land? 
Let's see... 
I know! At the beach. 
Go to Cape Doom. 
Just look forthe lighthouse. 
The lighthouse at Cape Doom it is. Oh, boy. I didn't hear that. 
This is great. 
But how do I get out of here? 
I'm just a sandwich. 
Some things you gotta 
figure out for yourself. 
By the way, you go ahead 
and eat me now. 
You're gonna need the energy. 
- But won't that hurt? 
- No, it's fine. I'm going away now. - Cape Doom, right? 
- Yes, Cape Doom. 
Are you there? 
Hello? 
Just a little further up. 
- Stop, Fozzie. Stop here. 
- That's it. 
Page 22/37
Sorry. 
Animal! 
Sorry. 
Stand back, boys. 
This is a job for a woman. 
Woman. 
What's a nice man like you doing in a guardhouse like this? 
I'm buffalo hunting. 
What's it look like I'm doing? This is a restricted area. 
You gotta go. 
Oh, no. 
Look deeply into my eyes 
and tell me you want me to go. I want you to go! 
Understand? 
Now! 
I thought I... 
What was I saying? 
You were saying you were 
going to open the gate. 
Open the gate. 
Of course, open the gate. 
Come on in. Welcome! 
Come on, guys! 
Tell me I'm beautiful, sweetheart. You are beautiful, sweetheart. Thank you. 
He fell on you 
like a ton of bricks, okay. 
Naturellement. 
- Have a nice time. 
- Gracias. 
- I like yourtie. Very nice. 
- Thank you. 
- So long. 
- Bye-bye! 
What a handsome family. 
Hey, rodents. 
You know the cheese I promised you... ...afteryou ran that maze 
and took those tests? 
It was delicious. 
Page 23/37
No cheese? 
No cheese?! 
All right! That does it! 
We're busting out 
of this joint, boys. 
Even if we got overthe wall, 
we couldn't turn the doorknob. Who needs doorknobs? 
Very nice. 
He likes it. 
We gotta get through that door. Should we just ask permission from those nice men with the rifles? Those are the bad guys. 
All right. 
It's time to get invisible. 
Get the duck. 
- Yes, sir. 
- Duckie! 
Here goes. 
- I look thinner. 
- Now spray yourself. 
Hey, I like this. 
All right, lose the duck. 
Listen up, guys. This stuff 
doesn't last long, so let's go. - You're squashing me. 
- Sorry, Kermie. 
Come on, Kermit. 
I will help you up, okay. 
Kermit, you're so soft and plump. You got one second to get 
your hands off me, shrimp. 
Sorry, Piggy. 
Come on. 
I have to go to the little bear's room. Smoking is very bad for you, okay. Bob... 
...didn't know you cared. 
Paging Dr. Van Neuter. Please 
report to alien surgery number five. I'm Dr. Van Neuter. 
I'll be your brain surgeon today, if you don't mind. 
Page 24/37
Get it? "Brain surgeon. Mind." Feeling a little nervous, are we? Of course I'm nervous. 
Everyone is 
before having their brain sucked out. Now, don't you go away. 
Okay, Kermit, I'm ready. 
Fozzie, tell me 
you didn't wash your hands. 
Of course I did. 
Mom said, "Always wash your hands." Not when you're wearing 
invisibility spray! 
Mom said, "No exceptions." 
Never, ever. 
What the... 
Stop! 
You, hands, up. 
All right, brother, remain calm. I'm gonna have to take 
you two into custody. 
Wait. Let me explain, lady. 
Where are yourforearms? 
Woman! 
Animal, get back here! 
Give me a second to think. 
He doesn't seem to be on this floor. I should go change, okay. 
Come on, everybody. 
We need to find better cover. 
Just up ahead here, 
General Luft, sir. 
There we go. 
This is our new 
retinal scanner, general. 
- General Luft, sir. 
- This had better be good. 
Come on, let's go. 
Hey, Riz. Where you going? 
Listen. You guys go ahead. 
I gotta go find my friend. 
You could get caught. 
What are you, nuts? 
I guess I'll take my chances. 
Page 25/37
It was nice meeting you guys. 
See you later. 
So long, Riz. 
Good luck. 
Kid's got moxie. 
What is moxie? 
Let's see here. 
Have you ever experienced 
any achiness in yourtentacles? I don't have tentacles. 
Good, no achy tentacles. Good. - Head ever come off? 
- I don't think so. 
Good, good, good. 
- Any gingivitis? 
- No. 
Great. 
Ever had problems with that 
beaky thing you've got there? 
Itching, swelling, flaking? 
- Some flaking a couple years ago. - Oh, who cares. 
It's showtime! 
Here we go. 
Excellent, excellent. 
What's that thing? 
I don't know. Here we go. 
Just stay like that. 
This way. 
Whose bright idea was this, anyway? Which way, Kermit? 
This way. 
I can't breathe! 
Come on. 
Here we go. 
Wait! 
What is it? 
Is this covered by my HMO? 
Good question. I'll check. 
You're alive! 
Where have you been? 
You don't want to know. Sit tight while I chew through these straps. Good news. You're covered 
Page 26/37
with a $10 co-pay. 
Okay, hold still. 
And remember, if you experience any unpleasantness, please let me know. I'd hate to miss it. 
- Do you mind? 
- Excuse me. 
Wait! 
Oh, good Lord! A rat! 
I hate rats! 
Then today ain't your lucky day, doc. - Ready for an operation? 
- Let's experiment! 
Forward, Piggy. 
Doctor. 
- Just a couple of doctors. 
- Doctors in the hallway. 
That was close. 
- To the right, Fozzie. 
- Forward, Piggy. 
Too fast, too fast. 
The door. Stop! 
What in the world? 
This is big, general. I think 
we should notify the President. I'll be the judge of that. 
As always, sir. 
No, don't tickle me! 
- What do we do? 
- Will you please get me out of here? I can't breathe! 
Hey, guys. 
Quick, get me out of here! 
Today, sir... 
...we must think with a big mind. Behold. 
Irrefutable evidence 
of extraterrestrial life. 
Release me... 
This looks worse than it is, general. Obviously, the... 
Get off of me, you vermin! 
The alien is loose in the building. But not to worry because... 
Page 27/37
Don't bother. 
You're terminated. 
- When you say terminated... 
- You need help, Singer! 
Find some! 
Well, how'd that 
go for you, then? Okay? 
So sorry I got you into this mess. Thanks for coming to save me. 
You can thank us once 
we're out of here. 
All right, quietly now. 
Stop! Come back here! 
Help! Mommy! 
Please, please. 
Listen to me. 
You can't leave me. 
I need you. 
I go now. 
Fine. Go on, go. 
You're all alike. 
Animals. 
Call me. 
Come here. 
Way to go, Romeo. 
Now, let's get out of here. 
Let's go. 
I'm gonna kill somebody. 
Now, now. 
Remember, calm blue ocean. 
You let it go. 
Baby steps, remember? Baby... 
Find the alien! 
Now! 
Yes, sir. 
- Try that door. 
- It won't budge! 
Forget that door. Come on! 
This way! 
Fozzie, quick! 
The door in a jar. 
"Open jar away from face." 
Will you please just open the jar? Hurry, Fozzie. 
Page 28/37
Come on, throw it! 
That's disappointing. 
Perfect. Somebody knock 
and see if Barbie's home. 
Works for me. Adis! 
What?! 
I cannot believe that 
little shrimp left us behind! 
I am not a shrimp. 
I am a king prawn! 
Let's go! Come on! 
Hurry, hurry! 
Keep going, everybody. 
Don't look back. Run! 
- Did you have a good time? 
- Thank you. 
Bye-bye, nice man. 
What the heck is going on? 
- We did it! 
- See that? 
When we pull together, 
we can do anything. 
Now we can go meet my alien 
brothers at Cape Doom. 
What makes you think that 
aliens are landing there? 
Oh, a sandwich told me. 
Oh, no. 
I'd give it a rest there, buddy. Do you mean that you guys 
still don't believe me? 
Well... 
All right, fine. Stop the bus. I'll get there by myself. 
No, no. Wait, Gonzo. 
It doesn't matterwhat we believe. If you believe that you need 
to go and meet your alien brothers... ...then I say... 
I say we're going to the beach. Right, guys? 
To the beach, okay. 
To the beach. 
Great! 
Page 29/37
Beach ball! Beach ball! 
Get the crew to Cape Doom 
on the double. 
And look, this is my exclusive, so don't tell anyone. 
I got it. 
Pack it up, guys! The spaceship is landing at Cape Doom. 
Where is he? 
Well, I didn't overhear anything... Did I ask you 
if you overheard anything? 
No, sir. 
Because if you did 
overhear anything... 
...l'm sure you would tell me. 
Yes, sir. 
Or do I have to remind you... 
...of Mr. Jumbo's Circus Town 
and Wild Animal Revue? 
Where's he going? 
Oh, look. 
Sunday's half price 
at the petting zoo. 
Okay, okay! 
They're going to Cape Doom. 
Good, good. 
Get me the subatomic 
neutro-destabilizer. 
The subatomic neutro... 
The really big gun. 
The really big gun. Yes, sir. 
The really big gun. 
Really big gun. 
Clip. 
Clip! 
Let's head for my car. 
Problem there, sir. 
Rememberthose parking tickets 
you asked me to take care of for you? And I said that... 
Oh, just say it. 
Car's impounded. 
We can take my company car. 
Page 30/37
- Fine. 
- Great. 
66 bottles of beer on the wall 66 bottles of beer 
Excuse me. 
Excuse me! 
Can this thing go any faster? 
I'm doing 30. 
You want to slow down there, buddy? A lot of traffic tonight, sir. Safety first. 
What's with all these crazy people? Can I help it if moi 
has such devoted fans? 
Gonzo! Gonzo! 
All right, everybody, back off! Make way forthe alien! 
Let His Weirdness through. 
Everybody be cool. 
Stay back. Be cool, okay. 
Get your Gonzo T-shirts right here. Ten bucks. 
Goodbye, Rainbow, and stay groovy. Got cold. 
Sure did. 
Midnight. The lone alien 
stands before a naked sky. 
The mood is tense. 
My hair looks great. 
I don't believe this! 
Shelley! Bonjour. 
You backstabbing, underhanded 
little coffee pig. 
- What? 
- This is my show! 
My story, my microphone. 
Shelley Snipes reporting. 
Please ignore the little sow. 
Disregard this woman. I... 
What am I doing? 
You are about to give me your job and get everyone here coffee. 
Oh, yes. Of course. 
Right away. 
Page 31/37
I love this stuff. 
How you doing? 
Excuse me, buddy. 
And a happy Halloween to you as well. It's all right. Take it easy. 
- Yeah, yeah. 
- All right. 
You don't understand. 
We let him slide, and he gave us a ride. Yeah, yeah. 
I love all my new rat friends now. Come on. 
Who wants this next marshmallow? Can you believe that? 
Hey, fellas! 
Look who's here over here. 
It's too bad Dawson isn't here. Tell me about it. This is like 
one of his sci-fi movies. 
But this is a Muppet movie. 
It's much more realistic... 
...and romantic, okay. 
Right. 
What's your deal? 
Are you an alien or something? 
No, baby. 
Me and Gonzo are very tight. 
We'll be chilling 
in our hot tub later on. 
Perhaps you'd like 
to partake in the party. 
Geeks. 
All right. Don't answer right away. We'll be here. 
Oh, she'll be back. 
One a.m. 
The alien is still 
standing overthere. 
My hair still looks great. 
One can only wonder... 
...what Gonzo's feeling right now. They're not coming. 
Maybe they're just running late. It's a no-show. 
Page 32/37
What? 
Hey, wait a second. 
I believed you, man. 
I stayed up all night dancing... ...and didn't study forfinals 
because of you. 
I'm cold. Come on, let's go. 
I'm out of here. 
Look! 
Boy! 
They're really tiny. 
But tiny's not a bad thing, right? No. Tiny's good. 
We came out here in the middle of the night for a stupid egg? It could be full of chocolate, okay. Shoot it! Shoot it! 
Please, Big Boss, 
I never disobeyed my mother. 
And I never carried the plague. Not even once! 
- Are you okay, Gonzo? 
- Great. Neverfelt better. 
Let the one who is called... 
...Gonzo step forward. 
That's me! 
I'm Gonzo. 
Step a little closer. 
Come a little furtherforward. 
Lean into the light. 
There you go. 
Lean in a little further. 
A little further. 
That's him! 
Many zotons ago... 
... you were lost to us. 
We've come a long way looking 
for you, little brother. 
We know of but one way... 
... to express our happiness 
at having found you. 
Nowthere's a party going on right here A celebration 
That's my family! 
Page 33/37
So bring your good times 
And your laughter too 
We're gonna celebrate 
Your party with you 
Celebration 
Let's all celebrate 
And have a good time 
Celebration 
We're gonna celebrate 
And have a good time 
It's time to come together 
It's up to you 
What's your pleasure 
Everyone around the world 
Come on 
Celebrate good times

to see you up here on the stage! - Me? 
- Yeah, you, boy! 
Look at him go, guys. 
Look at him up there! 
Celebrate good times 
Come on 
It's The Great Gonzo! 
This way. 
It is time to take your righteous place amongst your brothers. 
Thanks... 
Here you go. 
By surviving and thriving alone on this alien planet... 
...you have proven 
yourself audacious... 
...courageous and 
distinctly one of a kind. 
We welcome you back 
with our most... 
...ceremonious of ceremonies. 
What's that? 
We gonna blow you up, baby. 
Page 34/37

Yes, yes, yes! 
Arriba! 
I love these people! 
Coming down! 
Cowabunga! 
Where's he gone? 
He's okay! He's all right. 
Now that is what I call 
The Great Gonzo. 
It's so good to see you. 
Hold it! 
Hold it. 
Get out of the way, you freak. Very, very moving, 
my little alien friend. 
But I'm afraid yourtiming is off. Now... 
...you're coming back with me... ...in my cement truck. 
What's so funny? 
Don't laugh at me. 
Don't laugh... 
All right. 
I'll show you laughter! 
Please load weapon. 
Please load weapon. 
Come on. 
My toe! 
This certainly is good! 
That was a close one. 
Not as close as you think, my friend. "Please load weapon." 
- We are honored to meet you. 
- A most extraordinary performance. What are you talking about? 
Gonzo of Earth, who is this most entertaining friend of yours? 
That's Ed. 
The cape! 
The cape for Ed. 
Ed, because of your comic instincts... ...we have chosen you 
as ambassadorto our planet. 
You mean you want me to go with you? Page 35/37

"To boldly go where 
no man has gone before"? 
It would be our great privilege. May I call you Zongo? 
To travel the stars 
like a modern-day Magellan. 
To be up there with John Glenn... ...Neil Armstrong. 
I think you better get going. 
They're waiting for you. 
Run along now. 
This way, Zongo. 
Baby steps, sir. 
Baby steps. 
Time to beat feet. 
Come along, little brother. 
Oh, boy. 
This is happening so fast. 
Well, guys... 
...l'm gonna miss you. 
And I'll be thinking about you. Rizzo, buddy... 
No, no, not me. 
I do not do goodbyes. 
Well, I just want to tell you... I just want you 
to take care of yourself. 
Don't worry about me. I... 
I can always get another roommate. Oh, buddy. 
- Take care. 
- You too. 
And, Kermit... 
...you're the best friend 
any alien could ask for. 
We love you, Gonzo. 
So you'll write? 
Yeah, sure, I'll write. 
There's probably a mailbox 
every couple of light-years. 
Adis, Mr. Spaceman, okay. 
Man, you keep saying goodbye, 
and you'll never get home. 
Home. 
Page 36/37

Time to go home. 
The stars beckon. 
Shall we go home? 
I don't think so. 
Thank you for going 
to so much trouble to find me. But I can't go. 
I love these guys. 
My life is here. 
This is my home. 
If that is your decision... 
...then we shall abide by it. 
We will miss you. 
So good luck, Gonzo. 
People of Earth, later. 
Yes! 
Oh, boy. 
Goodbye! 
You're back! You're back! 
People of Earth... 
..."This is one small step for man... ...and one giant step for..." 
Forget it. 
What a great day! 
That was probably the best day of my whole life. 
There's one thing I don't understand. What's that, Gonzo? 
Why did they ask me to build a Jacuzzi? Page 37/37

Mr Bile, is it? 
Uh... my friends 
call me Phlegm. 
Uh-huh. 
Mr Bile, can you tell me 
what you did wrong? 
I fell down? 
No, no, before that. 
Can anyone tell me 
Mr Bile's big mistake? 
Anyone? 
( coughs ) 
( groans ) 
Let's take a look 
at the tape. 
Here we go. 
Uh, right... 
puh-puh-puh-puh... 
Ah! There, see? 
The door. 
You left it wide open. 
( whimpers ) 
( all murmuring ) 
And leaving the door open 
is the worst mistake 
any employee 
can make because...? 
Um... it could let in a draft? It could let in 
a child! 
Oh! Mr Waternoose! 
There is nothing more toxic 
or deadly than a human child. 
A single touch could kill you! Leave a door open 
and a child could walk 
right into this factory! 
Right into the monster world! 
I won't go in a kid's room! 
You can't make me! 
You're going in there 
because we need this. 
( children screaming ) 
( whimpering ) 
Page 3/74
( static and feedback ) 
( screaming stops ) 
Our city is counting on you 
to collect those children's screams. Without scream, we have no power. Yes, it's dangerous work 
and that's why I need 
you to be at your best. 
I need scarers 
who are confident, tenacious 
tough, intimidating. 
I need scarers like... like... James P. Sullivan. 
( snoring ) 
Hey! Good morning, 
Monstropolis. 
It's now five after 
the hour of 6: 
in the big monster city. 
Temperature's a 
balmy 65 degrees-- 
which is good news 
for you reptiles-- 
and it looks like it's 
going to be a perfect day 
to maybe, hey, 
just lie in bed, sleep in 
or simply... work out that flab that's hanging over the bed! 
Get up, Sulley! 
- ( honking ) 
- ( screaming ) 
I don't believe I ordered 
a wake-up call, Mikey. 
Hey! Less talk, more pain, 
marshmallow boy! 
- ( growling ) 
- Feel the burn! 
You call yourself 
a monster? 
( growling ) 
Scary feet, scary feet, 
scary feet! 
Page 4/74
Oop! The kid's awake! 
Okay, scary feet, scary feet, 
scary feet, scary feet-- 
Kid's asleep! 
( roaring ) 
Twins! In a bunk bed! 
( growling ) 
Ooh! I thought I had you there. Okay, Sulley, here we go. 
You ready? Follow it. 
Oh! It's over here! 
Oh, look over there! 
Don't let the kid 
touch you! 
Don't let it touch you! 
I don't know, 
but it's been said 
I love scaring kids in bed! 
Come on, fight that plaque! 
Fight that plaque! 
Scary monsters 
don't have plaque! 
Do I see 120? 
Oh, I don't believe it! 
I'm not even 
breaking a sweat. 
Not you! 
Look! The new 
commercial's on! 
( yells ) 
ANNOUNCER: 
The future is bright 
at Monsters, Incorporated. 
I'm in this one! 
I'm in this one! 
ANNOUNCER: 
We're part of your life. 
We power your car. 
We warm your home. 
We light your city. 
I'm Monsters, Incorporated. 
Hey, look! Betty! 
Page 5/74
ANNOUNCER: 
Carefully matching every child to their ideal monster... 
-( roars ) 
-( screams ) 
to produce superior scream 
refined into clean, 
dependable energy. 
Every time 
you turn something on 
Monsters, Incorporated 
is there. 
I'm Monsters, Incorporated! 
ANNOUNCER: 
We know the challenge-- 
the window of innocence 
is shrinking. 
Human kids are harder to scare. Of course, M.I. is prepared 
for the future 
with the top scarers... 
( child screaming ) 
the best refineries 
and research 
into new energy techniques. 
-( yelling ) 
-( shrieking ) 
Okay, here I come. 
We're working 
for a better tomorrow... today! 
WORKERS: 
We're Monsters, Incorporated! 
WATERNOOSE: 
We're M.I. 
Monsters, Incorporated. 
We scare because we care. 
I can't believe it. 
Oh, Mike... 
I was on TV! 
Did you see me? 
Page 6/74
I'm a natural! 
( phone rings ) 
Hello. 
I know! 
Hey, wasn't I great? 
Did the whole 
family see it? 
It's your mom. 
What can I say? 
The camera loves me. 
( bicycle bell rings ) 
I'm telling you, big daddy 
you're going to be seeing 
this face on TV a lot more often. ~Yeah? Like, on 
Monstropolis's Most Wanted? 
( mocking laughter ) 
You've been jealous 
of my good looks 
since the 
fourth grade, pal. 
Have a good day, sweetie. 
You, too, hon. 
Whoo! 
Okay, Sulley, hop on in. 
Nope. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! 
Where you going? 
What are you doing? 
Mikey, there's a scream shortage. We're walking. 
Walking?! Yep. 
No, no, no, my baby. 
Come on. Come on. 
Look, she needs 
to be driven. 
Bye, baby. 
I... I'll call you! 
MIKE: 
Hey, genius, 
you want to know why 
I bought the car? Huh? 
Not really. 
Page 7/74
To drive it! 
You know, like, 
on the street? 
With the honk-honk 
and the vroom-vroom 
and no walking involved. 
( mock whining ) 
Give it a rest, 
will you, butterball? 
Come on, you could 
use the exercise. 
I could use 
the exercise?! 
Look at you. 
You have your own climate! 
GIRL MONSTERS: 
How many tentacles 
jump the rope? 
BOY MONSTER: 
Morning, Mike! 
Morning, Sulley! 
Hey! Morning, kids. 
Hey, kids. 
How you doing? 
Bye, Mike! 
Bye, Sulley! 
BIG EYE: 
Ow! Hey! 
( humming ) 
( sneezing ) 
Ah, nuts. 
( singing ) 
Hey, hey, hey! Fellas! 
Hey, Tony! 
Tony! Ba-da-bing! 
-Hey, Tony! 
-Tony! 
Pow, pow, 
pow, pow, pow! 
I hear somebody's 
close to breaking 
Page 8/74
the all-time 
scare record. 
Ah, just trying 
to make sure 
there's enough scream 
to go around. 
( laughing ) 
Hey! On the house! 
-Hey, thanks! 
-Grazie! 
MIKE: 
Ba-da-bing! 
( startled gasp ) 
Oh, great. 
Hey, Ted! 
Good morning! 
( clucking ) 
See that, Mikey? 
Ted's walking to work. 
Big deal. 
Guy takes five steps 
and he's there. 
( phones ringing ) 
FEMALE MONSTER: 
Monsters, Inc. Please hold. 
Monsters, Inc. Please hold. 
Monsters, Inc. Please hold. 
Morning, Sulley. 
Morning, Ricky. 
Hey, it's the Sullster! 
See you on the scare floor, 
buddy! 
Hey, Marge. 
Hey, how was jury duty? 
Morning, Sulley! 
Hey! 
Hey, it's still 
leaning to the left. 
It is not! 
Hey, fellas. 
Hey,Jerry. 
Hey, Mr Sullivan! 
Page 9/74
Guys, I told you, 
call me Sulley. 
( nervous giggling ) 
I don't think so. 
We just wanted to wish 
you good luck today. 
Hey. Hey, hey, 
hey, hey! 
Come on, get lost, 
you two. 
You're making him 
lose his focus. 
Oh. Sorry. 
See you later, 
fellas. 
Go get 'em, 
Mr Sullivan! 
Quiet! You'll make 
him lose his focus. 
Oh, no. Sorry! 
Shut up! 
-( phones ringing ) 
-Monsters, Inc. Please hold. 
Monsters, Inc. I'll connect you. Ms Fearmonger is on vacation. 
Would you like her voice mail? Oh, Schmoopsie-poo. 
-( snakes squealing ) 
-Googley Bear! 
Happy birthday. 
Oh, Googley-woogley, 
you remembered! 
Hey, Sulley-wulley. 
Oh, hey, Celia... 
weelia. 
( clears throat ): 
Happy birthday. 
Thanks. 
So, uh... are we going 
anywhere special tonight? 
I just got us 
into a little place 
called, um... 
Harryhausen's. 
Page 10/74
( gasps ) 
Harryhausen's?! 
But it's impossible to 
get a reservation there! 
Not for Googley Bear. 
I will see you 
at quitting time 
and not a minute later. 
Okay, sweetheart. 
Think romantical 
thoughts. 
# You and me 
# Me and you 
# Both of us together! # 
You know, pal, she's the one. 
That's it. 
She is the one! 
I'm happy for you. 
Oh, and, uh, 
thanks for hooking me up 
with those reservations. 
Oh, no problem. 
They're under the 
name Googley Bear. 
Oh, good ide... 
You know, 
that wasn't very funny. 
( gasps ) 
What the...? 
Wazowski! 
( screams ) 
( grunts ) 
( chuckling ) 
What do you know? 
It scares little kids 
and little monsters. 
I wasn't scared. 
I have... allergies. 
( coughing ) 
Uh-huh. Sure. 
Hey, Randall, save it for 
the scare floor, will you? 
I'm in the zone today, 
Sullivan. 
Page 11/74
Going to be doing 
some serious scaring. 
Putting up some big numbers. 
Wow, Randall. 
That's great. 
That should make it 
even more humiliating 
when we break the record first. Ha, ha! 
Shh, shh, shh, 
shh, shh. 
Do you hear that? 
It's the winds of change. 
( mocking voice ): 
''You hear it? 
You hear the winds of ch...?'' Oh, what a creep. 
One of these days, 
I am really... 
going to let you 
teach that guy a lesson. 
( deep croaking ) 
( liquid squishing ) 
Chalooby! Baby! 
MIKE: 
Good morning, Roz 
my succulent 
little garden snail. 
And who would 
we be scaring today? 
Wazowski, you didn't file 
your paperwork last night. 
Oh, that darn paperwork. 
Wouldn't it be easier 
if it all just blew away? 
( chair squeaking ) 
Don't let it happen again. 
Yes, well, I'll, uh... 
I'll try to be less careless. 
I'm watching you, Wazowski. 
Always watching. 
Whoo! She's nuts. 
Always! 
Page 12/74
CELIA ( over P.A. ): 
All scare floors are now active. Assistants, please report 
to your stations.

( bell dings ) 
( clanking and whirring ) 
( chime rings ) 
Okay, people, 
eastern seaboard coming on-line. We got scarers coming out! 
( dramatic brass fanfare 
playing ) 
Ooh, they're 
so awesome. 
( knuckles cracking ) 
( clanging and growling ) 
( snarls ) 
( blowing ) 
( growling ) 
Hey... may 
the best monster win. 
I plan to. 
( bell ringing ) 
We are on in seven... six... 
five... four... three... 
two... 
( horn blaring ) 
( growls ) 
You're the boss. 
You're the boss. 
You're the big, 
hairy boss. 
( child screaming ) 
( bell dings ) 
Oh, I'm feeling 
good today, Mikey! 
Yeah! 
MIKE: 
Whoa! 
Attaboy. 
Attaboy. 
Page 13/74
Another door coming right up. 
( whirring and clanking ) 
( child screaming ) 
( bell dings ) 
( growling ) 
You're still behind, 
Randall. 
You know, maybe I should 
realign the scream intake valve. Just get me 
another door! 
A door! Yes, door! 
( child screaming ) 
( bell dings ) 
( bells dinging ) 
( beeping ) 
( metallic clanking ) 
( click and hiss ) 
( children screaming ) 
( bells dinging ) 
( children screaming ) 
Well,Jerry, what's 
the damage so far? 
We may actually 
make our quota today, sir. 
Hmm. First time 
in a month. 
( gurgling and burping ) 
Huh?! 
( door buzzing ) 
( screaming and sobbing ) 
What happened? 
The kid almost 
touched me! 
She got this close 
to me! 
She wasn't 
scared of you? 
She was only six! 
I could've been dead! 
I could've died! 
Keep it together, man. 
( whistling ) 
Hey! We got a dead 
Page 14/74
door over here! 
-We're coming! 
-Coming! 
-Look out! 
-Out of the way! 
-Coming through! 
-Excuse us. 
( whimpering ) 
We've lost 58 doors 
this week, sir. 
Oh, kids these days. 
They just don't get 
scared like they used to. 
Let her rip! 
( buzzing ) 
( metallic clank ) 
( eerie blubbering ) 
( child screaming ) 
( bell dings ) 
Uh, sir? 
What?! 
Look. 
CELIA ( over P.A. ): 
Attention. 
We have a new scare leader: 
Randall Boggs. 
( snickering ) 
( assistants cheering ) 
( children screaming ) 
( knuckles cracking ) 
Slumber party. 
( laughing ) 
Whoo! 
( beeping ) 
CELIA ( over P.A. ): 
Never mind. 
Hey! Watch it! 
( Sulley laughing ) 
Well, James, that was 
an impressive display! 
Oh, just doing my job, 
Mr Waternoose. 
Of course, I did 
learn from the best. 
Page 15/74
( both laughing ) 
If I don't see a new door at 
my station in five seconds 
I will personally 
put you through the shredder! 
( screams ) 
Hey, Wazowski, nice job! 
Those numbers are pretty sweet. Are they? 
You know, 
I hadn't even noticed. 
And, uh... 
how is Georgie doing? 
He's doing great! 
I love working 
with that big guy. 
( child screaming ) 
Keep the doors coming, 
Charlie. 
I'm on a roll today. 
George and I 
are like brothers. 
( gasping ) 2319! 
We have a 2319! 
( gasping ) 
( alarm blaring ) 
COMPUTER VOICE ( over P.A. ): 
Red alert! Red alert! 
Red alert! Red alert! Red alert! FEMALE ( over P.A. ): 
George Sanderson 
please remain motionless. 
Prepare for decontamination. 
Get it off! 
JERRY: 
Duck and cover, people! 
Oh, not the CD A. 
( siren wailing ) 
CDA AGENT 1: 
Move! Move! Move! 
Coming through, please. 
Stand aside. 
Page 16/74
CDA AGENT 2: 
Clear the contaminated area. 
( screams ) 
CDA AGENT: 
This is a 231 9 in progress. 
Keep the area clear. 
Coming through. 
Watch yourself. 
( grunts ) 
( whimpering ) 
Stand back. 
Careful. 
( metallic clang ) 
( drills whirring ) 
( all gasping ) 
( muffled explosion ) 
( drills whirring ) 
All clear. 
Situation is niner-niner-zero. Ready for decon. 
Hey, thanks, guys. 
That was a close one. 
Okay. 
( shears buzzing ) 
( screaming ) 
( whimpering ) 
( ripping ) 
( screaming ) 
JERRY: 
Okay, people, take a break! 
We got to shut down 
for a half-hour 
and reset the system. 
An entire scare floor 
out of commission. 
What else can go wrong? 
Oh... what a day. 
We're just going through 
a rough time, sir. 
Everyone knows you're going 
to get us through it. 
Page 17/74
Tell that to the 
board of directors. 
( slurping ) 
James, this company 
has been in my family 
for three generations. 
I would do anything to 
keep it from going under. 
Oh, so would I, sir. 
Well... 
Say, I could use your help 
with something. 
Anything, sir. 
You see, we've hired 
some new scare recruits 
and frankly, they're... 
they're, um... uh... 
Inexperienced? 
Oh, they stink! 
Uh-huh. 
And I thought maybe 
you might come by tomorrow 
and give them a demonstration. Show them what it takes 
to be a top scarer, huh? 
I'll start out with the old 
Waternoose jump-and-growl. 
( growling loudly ) 
Ha! Oh, oh, yes! 
Now, that's my boy! 
( both laughing ) 
( ringing ) 
JERRY: 
Let's go, everybody! 
All doors must be returned! 
No exceptions! 
-Whoo! 
-Oh, yeah. 
I've never seen anything 
like you today. 
You were on 
a roll, my man. 
Another day like this 
Page 18/74
and that scare record's 
in the bag. 
That's right, baby! 
Uh-huh. 
So get this-- 
as if dinner wasn't enough 
I'm taking her to 
a monster truck rally afterwards. Nice. 
What's on your agenda? 
I'm going to head home 
and work out some more. 
Again? You know, there's 
more to life than scaring. 
( sniffing ) 
Whew. Hey, can I 
borrow your odorant? 
Yeah. I got, uh... 
smelly garbage or old dumpster. You got low tide? 
No. 
How about wet dog? 
Yep. Stink it up. 
( growling ) 
You know, I am so romantic 
sometimes I think 
I should just marry myself. 
Give me a break, 
Mike. 
What a night of romance 
I got ahead of me. 
Tonight is about me 
and Celia. 
Ooh, the love boat 
is about to set sail. 
( ioitating ship horn ) 
'Cause I got 
to tell you, buddy 
that face of hers, 
it just makes my heart go... 
Yikes! 
Hello, Wazowski. 
Fun-filled evening 
planned for tonight? 
Page 19/74
Well, as a 
matter of fact... 
Then I'm sure you 
filed your paperwork 
correctly... for once. 
Your stunned silence 
is very reassuring. 
Oh, no. My scare reports-- 
I left them on my desk 
and if I'm not at 
the restaurant in five minutes they're going to give 
our table away! 
What am I going to tell... 
Schmoopsie-poo. 
Hey, Googley Bear. 
Want to get going? 
Do I ever! 
It's just that... 
What? 
Uh, you know, 
there's a small.... 
I don't understand. 
It's just that I forgot 
about some paperwork 
I was supposed to file. 
Mike was reminding me. 
Thanks, buddy. 
Whoo. 
I was? I mean, I was! 
Yeah, I was. 
Oh, okay. 
Let's go then. 
We're going! 
On my desk, Sulley. 
The pink copies 
go to Accounting 
the fuchsia ones 
go to Purchasing 
and goldenrod ones 
go to Roz. 
Huh! 
Leave the puce. 
Page 20/74
SULLEY: 
Pink copies go to Accounting, 
the fuchsia ones go to Roz. 
No, fuchsia ones 
go to Purchasing. 
The goldenrod ones go to Roz. 
Man, I have no idea 
what puce is. 
Oh, that's puce. 
Hmm? 
Uh, hello? 
Anyone? 
There's a door here. 
Hmm. 
( door latch clicking )

ALL: 
Get a paper bag! 
Mmm. 
( laughing ) 
Oh, Michael, I've had 
a lot of birthday... 
well, not a 
lot of birthdays 
but this is the 
best birthday ever. 
Hmm. 
What are you 
looking at? 
I was just thinking 
about the first time 
I laid eye on you-- 
how pretty you looked. 
Stop it! 
Your hair was 
shorter then. 
Mm-hmm. I'm thinking 
about getting it cut. 
( faint squeal of fear ) 
No, no, I like 
it this length. 
( sighs of relief ) 
I like everything 
about you. 
Just the other day 
someone asked me 
who I thought 
the most beautiful monster was in all of Monstropolis. 
You know what I said? 
What did you say? 
I said... 
Sulley? 
Sulley? 
No! No, no. 
That's not 
what I was going to say. 
Mike, you're not making sense. Page 23/74

SULLEY: 
Hi, guys! 
What a coincidence, 
running into you here! 
Uh, I'm just going 
to order something to go. 
Michael... 
Sulley! 
I wonder what's good here. 
Get out of here. 
You're ruining everything. 
I went back to get 
your paperwork 
and there was a door. 
What? 
( rattling ) 
A door?! 
Randall was in it. 
Wait a minute. 
Randall? 
That cheater! 
He's trying 
to boost his numbers! 
There's something else. 
What?! 
Ook-lay in the ag-bay. 
What?! 
Look in the bag. 
What bag? 
( sighs ) 
( gasps ) 
( giggling ) 
Oh! 
They don't have 
anything I like here. 
So take care, Celia! 
Excuse me, sir. 
What's going on? 
Celia, please try 
to understand. 
I have to do something! 
Michael?

There's a kid here--

Come on!

MIKE: 
Let's get out of here! 
CDA HELICOPTER PILOT: 
Please remain calm. 
This is not a drill. 
( siren wailing,

CDA AGENT: 
We have an 835 in progress. 
Please advise. 
Michael? Michael? 
Oh, Celia. 
-Please come with me. 
-Ow. Stop pushing. 
Hey, get your hands off 
my Schmoopsie-poo! 
Building clear. 
Ready for decontamination. 
Well, I don't think that date 
could have gone any worse. 
( explosion ) 
( electrical buzzing ) 
If witnesses are to be believed Page 25/74

there has been 
a child security breach 
for the first time 
in monster history. 
We can neither confirm nor deny the presence of 
a human child here tonight. 
Well, a kid flew right over me and blasted a car 
with its laser vision! 
I tried to run from it, 
but it picked me up 
with its mind powers 
and shook me like a doll! 
It's true! 
I saw the whole thing! 
It is my 
professional opinion 
that now is the time 
to... panic! 
Uh-oh. 
( both yelling ) 
Oh, it's coming! 
It's coming! 
( giggling ): 
Boo! 
( both screaming ) 
( distant sirens wailing ) 
( delighted cry ) 
( yelling ) 
No, no, no, no, no! 
Come here, kid. 
Whee. 
No, don't touch those, 
you little...! 
Oh, now 
those were alphabetized. 
It's okay, it's all right. 
As long as it doesn't 
come near us 
we're going to be okay. 
( sneezes ) 
( screams )

Oh, y-you like this? 
Fetch!

Hey, hey, that's it! 
No one touches 
little Mikey!

Mike, give her the bear. 
Oh, no. 
( piercing scream ) 
( electrical buzzing ) 
( screaming and crying

( buzzing continues ) 
( exclaiming in fear ) 
Make it stop, Sulley! 
Make it stop! 
Look! 
See the bear? 
Ooh, nice bear. 
( screams ) 
Sulley! 
See? 
Ooh, bear, ooh. 
Oh, he's 
a happy bear. 
He's not crying, 
neither should you 
Or we'll be in trouble 
'Cause they're gonna find us 
So please stop crying 
Right now. 
Good, good, Sulley. 
Keep it up. 
You're doing great. 
Ooh, the happy bear, 
he has no... 
( screaming ) 
Page 27/74
She touched me! 
Sulley, the bear! 
The bear! 
Give her the... 
Whoa! 
( giggles ) 
( screaming with laughter ) 
( electrical buzzing 
~ grows louder ) 
( light bulb shatters ) 
( giggles ) 
What was that? 
( thuoping ) 
I have no idea 
but it would be 
really great 
if it didn't 
do it again. 
( giggles ) 
Shh, shh, shh. 
Shh... 
Shh. 
Shh... 
Ah! 
How could I do this? 
How could I be so stupid? 
This could destroy 
the company. 
The company? 
Who cares 
about the company?! 
What about us? 
That thing is 
a killing machine! 
La-la-la-la-la-la 
I bet it's just waiting 
for us to fall asleep 
and then wham! 
Oh, we're easy prey, 
my friend-- easy prey. 
We're sitting targets. 
Okay, look, I think 
I have a plan here. 
Using mainly spoons, we dig 
Page 28/74
a tunnel under the city 
and release it into the wild. 
Spoons. 
That's it, I'm out of ideas. 
We're closed. 
Hot air balloon? 
Too expensive. 
Giant slingshot? 
Too conspicuous. 
Enormous wooden horse? 
Too Greek! 
( speaking baby talk ) 
No plan. No plan. 
Can't think. 
Can't think. 
Flatlining. 
Uh, Mike? 
I think she's getting tired. 
Well, then 
why don't you 
find someplace 
for it to sleep? 
While I think of a plan! 
Are you sleepy? 
You want to sleep? 
Is that what you want? 
Huh? 
( crunching ) 
Okay, all right. 
I'm making a nice 
little area for you to... 
( giggling ) 
No. Hey, hey, 
that's my bed! 
You're going to get 
your germs all over it. 
( sighing ): 
Fine. 
My chair is 
more comfortable anyway. 
( yells ) 
What? 
( speaking fearfully ) 
Page 29/74
It's just a closet. 
Will you go to sleep? 
Hey, that looks like Randall. 
Randall's your monster. 
You think he's going 
to come through the closet 
and scare you. 
Oh, boy, 
how do I explain this? 
Uh, it's empty. 
-See? 
-Ah! 
No monster in here. 
Well, now there is 
but I'm not going to scare you. I'm off-duty. 
Okay. 
How about I sit here, 
until you fall asleep? 
Go ahead. 
Go to sleep. 
Now. 
Now... go. 
Uh, you... 
go... 
to... 
sleep. 
( ioitating snoring ) 
( giggles ) 
( sighs in relief ) 
( door creaks softly ) 
Hey, Mike, 
this might sound crazy 
but I don't think 
that kid's dangerous. 
Really? Well, in that case, 
let's keep it. 
I always wanted a pet 
that could kill me! 
Now, look. 
What if we just put 
her back in her door? 
What? 
Mike, think about it. 
Page 30/74
If we send her back, 
it's like it never happened. 
Everything goes back to normal. Is that a joke? 
Tell me you're joking. 
Sulley, I'd like to think 
that, given the circumstances 
I have been extremely 
forgiving up to now 
but that is a horrible idea! 
What are we going to do? 
March right out into 
public with that thing? 
Then I guess we just waltz 
right up to the factory, right? I can't believe we 
are waltzing right 
up to the factory. 
Sulley, a mop, 
a couple of lights 
and some chair fabric 
are not going 
to fool anyone! 
Just think about 
a few names, will you? 
Loch Ness, Bigfoot, 
the Abominable Snowman-- 
they all got one thing 
in common, pal-- banishment. 
We could be next! 
Don't panic-- 
we can do this. 
Hey, how you doing, Frank? 
Hey, guys. 
Everything's going 
to be okay. 
( gasping ) 
( equipoent buzzing loudly ) 
Number One wants this place 
dusted for prints. 
Careful with that. 
I got a good view from here. 
A little lower. 
This was recovered 
Page 31/74
at the scene. 
Don't panic. 
Don't panic! 
Don't tell me 
not to panic. 
Just keep it together. 
Everything is not okay! 
LITTLE GIRL: 
Boo. 
...could be contaminated. 
Gentlemen, safety 
is our number one concern. 
If there's anything that... 
Not now, not now. 
Oh, hello, little one. 
Where did you come from? 
Mr Waternoose! 
Ah,James! 
Is this one yours? 
Actually, that's my, uh, 
cousin's sister's daughter, sir. Yeah, it's, uh... 
''Bring an Obscure Relative 
to Work Day.'' 
Hmm, must have 
missed the memo. 
Well, listen,James 
why don't you stop by 
the simulator after lunch today and give us 
that scare demonstration 
we talked about, huh? 
Oh, oh, sir, uh.... 
Excuse me, 
Mr Waternoose? 
Yes, yes, I'm coming. 
All right then, I'll see 
you this afternoon,James. 
That is, if these gentlemen 
haven't shut us down. 
Oh, boy. 
Oh, a scare demo. 
Well, that is great. 
Page 32/74
Why am I 
the last to know? 
We can bring your cousin's 
sister's daughter along. 
She'll be a big hit! 
( equipment buzzing loudly ) 
Halt! 
( yelling ) 
Stop him! 
Hold him down. 
Come on, 
the coast is clear. 
Okay, all we have to do 
is get rid of that thing. 
So, wait here while 
I get its card key. 
But she can't stay here. 
This is the men's room. 
That is the weirdest thing 
you have ever said. 
It's fine. It's okay. 
Look, it loves it here! 
It's dancing with joy! 
Uh, uh, uh, uh. 
I'll be right back 
with its door key. 
( laughs ) 
That's a cute little 
dance you've got. 
It almost looks 
like you've got to... 
( whining ) 
Oh. 
( singing in baby talk ) 
( singing stops ) 
Uh, are you 
done in there? 
( squeals ) 
Ah! Sorry. Sorry. 
( singing ) 
( toilet flushes ) 
Okay, you 
finished now, right? 
Hello? 
Page 33/74
( yells ) 
Boo. 
( giggles ) 
( sighs ) 
( giggling ) 
( chuckles ) 
Where did she go? 
Oh, did she disappear? 
Did she turn invisible? 
( giggling softly ) 
I just have no idea. 
Gotcha! 
Boo. 
( giggles ) 
Hey, you're good. 
( sighs ) 
Be relaxed, 
be relaxed, be relaxed. 
Roz, my tender, 
oozing blossom 
you're looking 
fabulous today. 
Is that a new haircut? 
Come on, tell me. 
It's a new haircut, 
isn't it? 
That's got to be 
a new haircut. 
New make-up? 
You've had a lift. 
You've had a tuck. 
You've had something. 
Something has been 
inserted in your skin 
that makes you look like... 
( sighs ) 
Listen, I need a favor. 
Randall was working 
late last night 
out on the scare floor. 
I really need the key 
for the door he was using. 
Well, isn't that nice? 
But guess what? 
Page 34/74
You didn't turn in 
your paperwork last night. 
He didn't... I... 
no paperwork? 
This office is now closed. 
( Mike screams in pain ) 
Ready or not, here I come! 
I'm getting warmer. 
Any second now. 
Fee fi fo... 
What are you doing?! 
I-I'm looking 
for the kid. 
You lost it?! 
No, no, she was just.... 
( squeals ) 
Here she is. 
( whining ) 
Hey, what's the matter? 
RANDALL: 
I already told your buddies 
I haven't seen anything. 
CDA AGENT: 
All right. Carry on. 
( splashing ) 
Randall! 
Thank goodness! 
What are we going to do 
about the child? 
Shh! 
Shh, shh, shh. 
( door slaos open ) 
( door slaos open ) 
The front page! 
It's on the front page. 
The child-- 
the one you were after. 
Will you be quiet?! 
Don't you think I'm aware 
of the situation? 
I was up all night 
trying to find it. 
Page 35/74
I did a simple 
calculation 
factoring in the size 
of the sushi restaurant. 
The child 
may have escaped! 
Yeah, well, until 
we know for sure 
we're going to act like 
nothing happened, understand? 
You just get the 
machine up and running. 
I'll take care of the kid. 
And when I find whoever 
let it out, they're dead! 
Oh! 
Why are you still here? 
Come on, go! 
Move! Now! 
FUNGUS: 
Ow, ow! I'm not here. 
SULLEY ( whispering ): 
They're gone. 
( squeaking and splashing ) 
LITTLE GIRL: 
Ew. 
MIKE: 
This is bad. 
This is so very bad. 
What were they talking 
about a machine? 
Who cares? Oh! 
Look, don't panic-- 
all we have to do 
is call her door down 
and send her home. 
You're right. 
You're right. 
We're just two regular joes 
on our way to work. 
We will blend right in. 
Page 36/74
Top of the mornin', fellas! 
Hey, what's shakin', 
bacon? 
Did you lose weight? 
Or a limb? 
You have 
her card key, right? 
Of course 
I have her card key. 
I told you 
I'd get her card key. 
I went and got 
her card key 
and now I have her card key. 
Okay, here we go. 
Take care of yourself. 
Try not to run 
through any more closets. 
( giggles ) 
Mike, 
that's not her door. 
What are you 
talking about? 
Of course it's her door. 
It's her door. 
No, her door was white 
and it had flowers on it. 
No. It must have been 
dark last night 
because this is its door. 
( polka ousic playing ) 
Hey, you hear that? 
Sounds like fun in there! 
Okay, send me a postcard, kid. That's Mike Wazowski, care of 
you-got-your-life-back Lane. 
Mowki Kowski. 
Very good. 
Now bon voyage! 
Bye-bye! 
Come on. 
Look at the stick. 
See the stick? 
Go get the stick! 
Page 37/74
Go fetch. 
Mike, this isn't 
Boo's door. 
Boo? What's Boo? 
That's what I decided 
to call her. 
Is there a problem? 
Sulley, you're not 
supposed to name it. 
Once you name it, 
you start getting attached to it! Now put that thing 
back where it came from, 
or so help me... 
Oh, hey! 
We're rehearsing a scene 
for the upcoming company play 
~called Put That Thing 
Back Where It Caoe Froo 
Or So Help Me. 
( Mike laughing ) 
It's a musical! 
Put that thing back where 
it came from or so help me 
Bom-bom, bom-bom, 
bom-bom... 
So help me, 
so help me. 
And cut! 
We're still working on it. 
It's a work in progress 
but, hey, 
we need ushers. 
Sulley, I've had enough. 
Now say goodbye to... 
where'd it go? 
What'd you do with it? 
( gasps ): 
Where is she? 
I don't believe it. 
She got away 
from you again?! 
Well, that is just... 
Page 38/74
Wait a minute. 
The sun is coming up. 
This is perfect! 
She's gone! 
Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
Where are you going? 
Sulley, please, 
don't blow this. 
Not when we're so close 
to breaking the record. 
Somebody else 
will find the kid. 
It'll be their problem, 
not ours! 
She's out of our hair! 
What are you 
two doing? 
They're rehearsing a play. 
She's out of our hair! 
Can it, Wazowski! 
So, what do you think 
of that kid getting out, Sullivan? Pretty crazy, huh? 
Oh, yeah, crazy. 
Word on the street is the kid's been traced back 
to this factory. 
You haven't seen anything, 
have you? 
Uh, well, uh... 
No, no way! 
But if it was 
an inside job 
I'd put my money 
on Waxford. 
Waxford? 
Yeah, the one 
at station six. 
You know, he's got 
them shifty eyes. 
Hey, Waxford! 
Sulley! 
CELIA: 
Page 39/74
Michael Wazowski! 
( whiopers ) 
Last night was one 
of the worst nights 
of my entire life, 
bar none! 
( hissing ) 
I thought 
you cared about me. 
Honey, please. 
Schmoopsie, I thought 
you liked sushi. 
CELIA: 
Sushi? Sushi?!! 
You think this is 
about sushi?! 
Wazowski! 
Michael! Mike... 
Men. 
( panting ) 
Breathe. Keep breathing. 
Whew. 
Yikes! 
Where's the kid? 
Kid? What kid? 
It's here in 
the factory, isn't it? 
You're not 
pinning this on me. 
It never would 
have gotten out 
if you hadn't been 
cheating last night! 
Cheating? 
Cheating. Right. 
Okay, I think I know how 
to make this all go away. 
What happens when 
the whistle blows 
in five minutes? 
Uh... I get a time-out? 
Everyone goes to lunch! 
Which means the scare floor 
Page 40/74
will be...? 
Painted? 
Empty! It'll be 
empty, you idiot! 
You see that clock? 
When the big hand 
is pointing up 
and the little hand 
is pointing up 
the kid's door 
will be in my station. 
But when the big hand 
points down 
the door will be gone. 
You have until then 
to put the kid back. 
Get the picture? 
( roaring playfully ) 
Boo! 
( giggles ) 
No. 
Hey, you! Halt! 
He's the one. 
The one from 
the commercial! 
Affirmative. 
That's him. 
Can we get 
an autograph? 
Oh, oh, sure. 
No problem. 
You can make that out 
to Bethany, my daughter. 
Yes. Let's see.... 
''From your scary friend 
best wishes...'' 
So I said, 
''If you talk to me 
like that again, 
we're through!'' 
What'd she say? 
You know my mom. 
She sent me to my room. 
See you guys later. 
Page 41/74
Take it easy. 
Bottoms up! 
( gasps in horror ) 
No! 
( singing ) 
Whoa! 
Hey. 
( growling ) 
Oh, well, hello, there. 
What's your name? 
Mike Wazowski! 
( machinery pounding loudly ) 
( grinding and chopping ) 
( panting ) 
( moans ) 
Sulley! 
Oh, Sulley. 
Okay, Sulley, come on, enough. Hey, you guys seen 
Sulley anywhere? 
Nope. Sorry. 
Oh, Sulley! 
Boy, Wazowski looks 
like he's in trouble. 
( squeaking and quacking ) 
We have a 231 9! 
Oh, dear. 
Get him! 
Sulley? 
Sulley! 
( ooaning ) 
Sulley! 
Oh, great news, pal. 
I got us a way out of this mess but we got to hurry. 
Where is it? 
( whiopering ) 
Sull, that's 
a cube of garbage. 
( squeaks ) 
Uh-oh. 
I-I can still hear 
her little voice. 
Page 42/74
BOO: 
Mike Wazowski! 
Hey, I can hear her, too. 
BABY MONSTERS: 
Mike Wazowski! 
How many kids 
you got in there? 
Mike Wazowski! 
Kitty! 
Boo! 
Boo, oh, 
you're all right! 
I was so worried! 
Don't you ever run away 
from me again, young lady! 
Oh, but I'm so glad 
you're safe. 
My, what an affectionate father. Actually, she's 
my cousin's sister's... 
Okay, Sulley. 
That's enough. 
Let's go. 
Mike Wazowski! 
Yeah, yeah. 
Step aside, kid. 
We're in a... 
( screams in pain ) 
( screams with laughter ) 
( electrical buzzing ) 
( light bulbs shattering ) 
( gasping ) 
( baby monsters screaming 
and crying ) 
Will you stop 
making Boo laugh? 
I didn't, so come on! 
( screaming and crying 
continue ) 
I still don't understand. 
You've got Boo's door? 
I'll explain later. 
Run. 
Page 43/74
Okay, let's move, 
let's move, let's move. 
Come on. 
Oh, please be there, please 
be there, please be there. 
There it is! 
Just like Randall said! 
Randall? 
Wait a minute. 
( cries out in fear ) 
Oh, hey. 
One, two, three, four! 
Get the kid back 
through the door! 
Hey, hey. 
We're going to get 
our lives back. 
The nightmare is over. 
Hey, it's okay, Boo. 
What's the matter? 
Come on, it's time to move! 
Mike, what are you thinking? 
We can't trust Randall. 
He's after Boo. 
Who cares? 
Let's go. 
This is a limited time offer. 
No, no. 
I don't like this. 
Look, Sulley, you wanted 
her door and there it is. 
Now, let's move. 
No, Mike. 
( sighs ): 
You want me to prove 
everything's on the up-and-up? Fine! He wants the door, 
I get the door... 
( whispering ): 
Mike, wait! 
He's a paranoid 
delusional furball. 
Page 44/74
Mike! 
( whiopers in fear ) 
( whining ) 
Shh, shh, shh. 
( soall cry of surprise ) 
( lunch bell rings ) 
Hey, Sulley, 
where you been all day? 
Sulley? Sulley? 
Huh? 
( whispering ): 
Mike? 
Mike? 
Where are you? 
You in there? 
Where are you, buddy? 
Mike? 
Hey. 
( door thunks ) 
( excited baby talk ) 
Boo, way to go. 
( giggles ) 
It's okay. 
( door clunks shut ) 
( pipes whistling and venting ) ( distant voices ) 
RAND ALL: 
Yes! I got the kid! 
FUNGUS: 
Oh, huzzah! 
That's great news. 
Not that I was concerned, 
of course. 
Just get over 
here and help me! 
Come on, come 
on, come on. 
While we're young 
here, Fungus! 
( both straining ) 
Kid needs to take 
Page 45/74
off a few pounds. 
( yelps ) 
Wazowski?! 
Where is it, 
you little one-eyed cretin? 
Okay, first of all, 
it's cree-tin. 
If you're going 
to threaten me 
do it properly. 
Second of all, you're nuts 
if you think kidnapping me 
is going to help you cheat 
your way to the top! 
( chuckling evilly ) 
You still think this is about 
that stupid scare record? 
Well... I did, right up 
until you chuckled like that 
and now I'm thinking 
I should just get out of here. I am about to revolutionize 
the scaring industry 
and when I do, even 
the great James P. Sullivan 
is going to be 
working for me. 
MIKE: 
Well 
somebody's certainly 
been a busy bee. 
First, I need to know 
where the kid is 
and you're going 
to tell me. 
Yeah, I don't 
know anything. 
Uh-huh, sure. 
MIKE: 
I don't. 
I mean, I don't. 
Uh-oh. 
Page 46/74
( oechanical clanging 
~ and grinding ) 
What's that? 
Come on. 
Wait, wait, wait. 
Oh-oh. Oh-oh. 
Oh, come on. 
No, no, no, no, no. 
Come on, 
hey, hey, hey. 
This thing is moving. 
I don't like big... 
moving things that are 
moving towards me. 
No! Come on! 
Hey, Randall! 
Say hello 
to the scream extractor. 
Hello. 
Come on, 
where you going? 
We'll talk. 
Come on, 
we'll have a latte! 
Come on. 
We can talk 
about this. 
( electrical whirring starts, 
~ then grows louder ) 
What's that thing? 
What is that thing? 
Wait, wait, wait! 
Stop, stop! 
No, no! 
Come on, hey! 
( deep, resonating whirring ) 
Help! Help! Help! 
Help! 
( yelling ) 
( noise dies away ) 
Oh, for... 
What did you 
do wrong this time? 
I don't know. 
Page 47/74
I calibrated the drive... 
Go check the machine! 
There must be something wrong 
with the scream intake valve. 
That's the problem 
with these 3250 units... 
Huh? 
Hmm. 
Psst! 
Fungus. 
Fungus. 
You like cars, huh? 
'Cause I got a really nice car. If you let me go, 
I'll give you... 
a ride in the car. 
Please, Fungus? 
I'm sorry, Wazowski, 
but Randall said 
I'm not allowed to fraternize 
with victims of his evil plot. ( gasps ) 
( clanging ) 
Hmm... 
( zapping ) 
( electrical whirring ) 
( clanking, rattling, whirring ) ( gasps ) 
( muffled screams ) 
What happened? 
Where's Wazowski? 
( muffled screams ) 
( shuts off machine ) 
Where is he?! 
( whimpering ) 
( growls ) 
( whimpering ) 
( squeals ) 
Come on! 
This is crazy. 
He's going to kill us! 
CD A AGENT: 
Careful. 
Page 48/74
That could be contaminated. 
We got to get out of here now! We can start a whole new life 
somewhere far away. 
Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.! 
Goodbye, Mr Waternoose! 
No, Mike, wait! 
Hey, what are you doing? 
Follow me. I have an idea. 
No! No, no, no, no, 
no, no, no, no... 
COMPUTER VOICE ( over P.A. ): 
Simulation terminated. 
WATERNOOSE: 
No, no, no, no, no. 
What was that? 
You're trying to scare the kid, not lull it to sleep. 
I was going for a 
snake/ ninja approach 
with a little hissing. 
( hisses ) 
How many times 
do I have to tell you? 
It's all about presence! 
About how you enter the room! 
Mr Waternoose! 
James! Perfect timing. 
No, no. Sir, you 
don't understand. 
Ah, now, show these monsters 
how it's done. 
What? No, no, 
I can't... 
Sir... 
sir, you have 
to listen to me. 
Pay attention, everyone. 
You're about to see 
the best in the business. 
Reset the simulator. 
But-but, sir! 
Page 49/74
MOTHER: 
Good night, sweetheart. 
ANIMATRONIC BO Y: 
Night, Mom. 
Kitty! 
No, Boo, no, no! 
Now, give us a big, loud roar. Mr Waternoose, 
there's no time for this. 
Come on. What are you 
waiting for? Roar! 
But-but-but, sir! 
Roar! 
( groans ) 
( roaring ferociously ) 
( shrieking in terror ) 
( gasps ) 
( roaring ferociously ) 
( squeals ) 
( Boo crying ) 
( students applauding ) 
WATERNOOSE: 
Well done. 
Well done,James. 
Boo? 
-All right, gentlemen, 
I hope you've learned... 
-Right this way, everyone. 
...a valuable lesson 
in scaring today. 
( fearful whioper ) 
( whines softly ) 
Boo. 
( nervous grunt ) 
( whining ) 
Boo? 
( panicked grunts ) 
( door slaos ) 
Boo, it's me. 
( squealing ) 
( gasps ): 
The child! 
Page 50/74
Sir, she isn't toxic. 
I know it sounds 
crazy, but trust me. 
Boo? 
No, no, no, no. 
It's okay. 
I was just... 
( whiopering in fear ) 
No, no, no, no, no, 
don't be scared. 
That wasn't real. 
It's just a... 
I was just... 
( crying ): 
No... 
( Boo continues crying ) 
( Boo sobbing ) 
Boo. 
MIKE: 
...and he was going 
to test it out 
on that sweet, 
little girl. 
Boo. 
Now that we 
have her... 
...he is trying 
to kill us. 
This whole thing 
is Randall's fault. 
Randall? 
Yes. And we can take 
you to his secret lab, 
which is right here 
in this factory. 
How could this happen? 
Oh, how could this happen? 
Does anyone else 
know about this? 
No, sir. 
Good. 
This company can't afford 
Page 51/74
any more bad publicity. 
Now, before we do 
anything else, let's... 
take care of the child. 
Oh, I never thought things 
would come to this... 
not in my factory. 
I'm sorry you boys 
got mixed up in this. 
Especially you,James. 
But now we can set 
everything straight again 
for the good of the company. 
( whirring ) 
( thunk ) 
MIKE: 
Uh... 
sir, that's not her door. 
I know, I know. 
It's yours. 
( startled gasps ) 
( grunts ) 
( yelling ) 
No! 
( gasps ) 
( voice echoing ): 
Boo! 
( gasps ) 
No! No! 
No! No! No! No! 
No! 
( desperate grunts ) 
It's too late! 
We're banished, genius. 
We're in the human world! 
Oh, what a great idea, going 
to your old pal Waternoose! 
Too bad he was in 
on the whole thing! 
All you had to do was listen 
to me--just once! 
But you didn't, did you? 
You're still not listening! 
Page 52/74
( yelling ) 
( Sulley grunting and groaning ) Take that! 
( growling ) 
( gasps in horror ) 
Welcome to the Himalayas! 
( wind gusting ) 
''Abominable''! 
( chuckles ) 
Can you believe that? 
Do I look abominable to you? 
Why can't they call me 
the Adorable Snowman or... 
or the Agreeable Snowman, 
for crying out loud? 
I'm a nice guy. 
Snow cone? 
Yuck. 
No, no, no. 
Don't worry-- 
it's lemon. 
Uh, how about 
you, big fella? 
Snow cone? 
Did you see the way she... 
looked at me? 
( sighs ) 
Ah, poor guy. 
I understand. 
It ain't easy 
being banished. 
Take my buddy, Bigfoot. 
When he was banished 
he fashioned an enormous diaper out of poison ivy. 
Wore it on his head 
like a tiara. 
Called himself King Itchy. 
Ah, it won't be so hard for 
you guys, though, you know. 
I mean, how lucky 
can you get? 
Banished with your 
best friend. 
Page 53/74
He is not my friend. 
Oh. I just assumed you 
were buddies, you know 
when I saw you out 
there in the snow 
hugging and all that. 
Look at that big jerk. 
Ruined my life, and for what? 
A stupid kid! 
Because of you, 
I am now stuck 
in this frozen 
wasteland! 
Wasteland? 
I think you mean wonderland! 
I mean, how about 
all this fabulous snow, huh? 
Oh, and wait till you see 
the local village. 
Cutest thing in the world. 
I haven't even mentioned 
all the free yak's milk. 
What... what did you say? 
Yak's milk. 
Milking a yak 
ain't exactly a picnic. 
You know, once you pick 
the hairs out 
it's very nutritious. 
No, no. Something 
about a village. 
Where? 
Are there kids in it? 
Kids? Sure. 
Tough kids, sissy kids, 
kids who climb on rocks... 
Where is it?! 
It's at the bottom 
of the mountain. 
Around a three-day hike. 
Oh, three days?! 
We need to get there now! 
( thuop ) 
( ding ) 
Page 54/74
You want to go to the village? Okay, rule number one 
out here. 
Always... 
No. 
Never go out in a blizzard. 
We need to get to Boo. 
( grunts, then gasps ) 
Boo?! 
What about us? 
( grunts ) 
Ever since that kid 
came in 
you've ignored 
everything I've said 
and now look where we are! 
Oh, we were about 
to break the record, Sulley. 
We would have had it made! 
None of that matters now. 
None of it matter... 
Wa-wait a second. 
None of it matters? 
( sighs ) 
MIKE: 
Okay. 
That's.... no. Good. Great. 
So, now the truth 
comes out, doesn't it? 
Oh, would you 
look at that? 
We're out of 
snow cones, uh... 
Let me... just go outside 
and make some more. 
Sulley, what about everything 
we ever worked for? 
Does that matter? 
Huh? 
And what about Celia? 
I am never... never 
going to see her again. 
Doesn't that matter? 
Page 55/74
( sighs ) 
What about me? 
I'm your pal. 
I'm... I'm your best friend. 
Don't I matter? 
( sighs ) 
I'm sorry, Mike. 
I'm sorry we're stuck out here. I didn't mean 
for this to happen. 
But Boo's in trouble. 
I think there might 
be a way to save her 
if we can just 
get down to that... 
''We''? 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. ''We''? 
No. 
There's no ''we'' this time, pal. I-if-if you want 
to go out there 
and freeze to death 
you be my guest... 
because you're on your own. 
( wind whistles ) 
Hey, I got more snow cones! 
Ohh! 
Ahh! 
Ahh! 
( yells ) 
( grunting and groaning ) 
( wind howling ) 
( distant child screaming ) 
( children screaming ) 
Oh, come on, now, George. 
I know you can do this. 
I picked out an easy door 
for you-- in Nepal. 
Nice, quiet Nepal. 
You know, you're right. 
Here, take this. 
Go get 'em, Georgie! 
Gangway! Look out! 
Coming through! 
Page 56/74
Sorry, George. 
Hey, you can't just... 
( gasps ) 
( gagging ) 
( whistling ) 
Out of the way! 
-Hey! 
-Whoa! 
Don't! 
( gasps ) 
( whiopers ) 
Finally! 
I never should have 
trusted you with this. 
Because of you, I had 
to banish my top scarer! 
With this machine, 
we won't need scarers. 
Besides, Sullivan got 
what he deserved. 
Sullivan was twice the scarer 
you will ever be! 
( low growl ) 
( panting ) 
( clanging ) 
( grunting ) 
( yells with effort ) 
( oechanical whirring ) 
( gasps ) 
Kitty! 
( whirring and hissing ) 
( yelling ) 
( shrieking ) 
( roaring ) 
Kitty! 
Sullivan? 
( grunting ) 
Wh-whoa! 
Kitty! 
Sorry, Boo. 
Stop him! 
( growls ) 
Let's get you home. 
( panting ) 
Page 57/74
( blow lands ) 
Ooh! 
WATERNOOSE: 
Finish him off! 
Oh! Ooh! Oh! 
( clanging ) 
( thunk ) 
You don't know how long 
I've wanted to do 
that, Sullivan. 
( grunts ) 
( chuckles ) 
( punches landing ) 
Hah! 
Ooh! 
( shrieks ) 
( panting ) 
Ooh! 
Mike?! 
Look, it's not that I 
don't care about the kid. 
Mike, you don't 
understand. 
Yes, I do. I was 
just mad, that's all. 
I needed some time to think. 
But you shouldn't 
have left me out there. 
( thuop ) 
I'm being attacked! 
No, I'm not attacking you. 
I'm trying to be honest. 
Just hear me out. 
You and I are a team. 
Nothing is more important 
than our friendship. 
I-I-I know, kid. 
He's too sensitive. 
( gagging ) 
( whining cry ) 
Come on, pal. 
If you start crying, 
I'm going to cry 
Page 58/74
and I'll never get through this. I'm sorry 
I wasn't there for you 
but I am now. 
Ow! 
Sulley, I am baring 
my soul here. 
The least you could do 
is pay attention! 
( yells in pain ) 
( sighs in relief ) 
Hey, look at that-- 
it's Randall! It's... 
Oh. 
Come on! 
WATERNOOSE: 
Get up! 
There can't be 
any witnesses. 
There won't be. 
I'm glad you came back, Mike. 
Somebody's gotta take care 
of you, you big hair ball. 
( Celia yelling ) 
( screaming ) 
Ow! 
Schmoopsie-poo, 
I really can't talk. 
Come on! 
Michael, if you 
don't tell me 
what's going on right 
now, we are through! 
You hear me? Through! 
Here's the truth. 
You know the kid that they're 
looking for-- Sulley let her in. We tried to 
send her back 
but Waternoose 
had this secret plot 
and now Randall's right behind us and he's trying to kill us! 
Page 59/74
You expect me to believe that 
pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?! 
Mike Wazowski! 
( startled yell ) 
I love you, Schmoopsie-poo! 
RANDALL: 
Move it! Look out, you... 
Oh! 
...idiot! 
( huffing ) 
Look out. Coming through, 
here, coming through! 
Make way. Move it! 
Hurry up. Hurry up. 
There they are! 
CELIA: 
Attention, employees: 
Randall Boggs 
has just broken 
the all-time scare record. 
Huh? 
No, I didn't. 
Get out of my way! 
( all clamoring ) 
Go get 'em, Googley Bear! 
( Boo shrieks ) 
There it is! 
RANDALL: 
Get off my tail! 
Let me through! 
Sulley, 
what are you doing? 
Grab on, Mike! 
Are you out of your...? 
( screaming ) 
( whirring ) 
( Mike whimpering ) 
MIKE: 
Sulley, what are we doing? 
We have to get Boo's door 
Page 60/74
and find a station. 
MIKE: 
What a plan-- 
simple, yet insane! 
( growls ) 
Whoa. 
Oh, boy. ( gasps ) 
Hold on! 
( Mike screaming ) 
( screaming ) 
( clinking ) 
Wow! 
Don't look down! 
( teeth chattering ) 
( rattling ) 
( startled gasp ) 
( screaming ) 
( shrieking ) 
I'm gonna be sick. 
I'm gonna be sick! 
Whoa! 
( screaming ) 
Oh, no! 
( chugging and clanking ) 
No! 
Aah... 
Boo's door? 
There it is! 
MIKE: 
How are we supposed 
to get it now? 
Oh, it's a dead 
end, Sulley! 
( gasps ) 
MIKE: 
There he is. 
Make her laugh. 
What, Sulley?! 
Just do it! 
Oh... ow! 
( laughing ) 
Page 61/74
( squealing laughter ) 
( engines starting ) 
SULLEY: 
Get it open. 
Here he comes. 
Give me that kid! 
( birds twittering ) 
( Boo giggling ) 
Why couldn't we 
get banished here? 
Come on. We got to 
find another door. 
( gasps ) 
Look, Boo's door! 
( grunting ) 
There he is! 
Hurry up, hurry up! 
Give me your hand. 
( screaming ) 
( grunts ) 
Come on, it slides, 
it slides! 
Ooh, right, right, right. 
( panting ) 
( gasps ) 
Jump! 
I'm behind you! 
Come on! 
Hurry up! Keep moving! 
Get inside! 
Ooh! That was weird. 
( grunts ) 
Mike? 
Oh, sorry, buddy. 
( stunned mumbling ) 
( growls ) 
( electronic whirring ) 
Oh! 
I hope that hurt, lizard boy! 
( laughing ) 
Great job, buddy. 
We lost him. 
( squeals ) 
Page 62/74
Boo! 
Ha, ha! 
No! 
( screaming ) 
Nice working with you! 
Get it open! 
-I'm trying! 
-Open the door! 
Come on, get in here! 
( Boo crying ) 
( grunting ) 
Boo! 
( panting ) 
( panting ) 
There they are! 
Sulley, what are you doing? 
Sulley! 
( grunts ) 
( grunts ) 
( yells ) 
Looks like we caught 
the express, pal. 
Do you see them? 
Straight ahead! 
No... 
( stifled cry ) 
( grunting nervously ) 
Kitty! 
Boo! 
( yelling ) 
( whimpering ) 
RANDALL: 
Look at everybody's 
favorite scarer now! 
You stupid, pathetic waste! 
( thump ) 
You've been number one 
for too long, Sullivan. 
Now your time is up! 
And don't worry. 
I'll take good care of the kid. No! 
( yelling ) 
Page 63/74
( Boo grunting 
~ and Randall gagging ) 
( Randall groaning ) 
( gagging ) 
( roaring angrily ) 
She's not scared 
of you any more. 
( roars angrily ) 
Looks like you're out of a job. ( gulps ) 
All right, come on, 
over the plate. 
Let's see 
the ol' stuff here, pal. 
Come on, now, chuck him, 
chuck him, baby. Hum, baby. 
Hum, baby, 
here's the pitch. 
Wait, please, don't, 
don't, don't! 
No! 
And he is... 
out of here! 
( crickets chirping ) 
BOY: 
Mama, another gator 
got in the house. 
Another gator?! 
Give me that shovel! 
Come here! 
( clanging, yelling ) 
Get him, Mama! 
Get that gator! 
Care to do the honours, 
Mikey? 
With pleasure. 
( thud ) 
( baby talk ) 
That's right, Boo. 
You did it. 
You beat him. 
( raspberry ) 
Come on. 
Page 64/74
Okay, Boo, 
it's time to go home. 
Take care of yourself, 
and be a good girl, okay? 
( gasps ) 
Oh, no! 
The power's out! 
Make her laugh again. 
All right, I got a move here. 
It'll bring down the house. 
Up... 
( oetallic clang ) 
( groans softly ) 
Oh, sorry, she didn't see that. What?! What'd you do, 
forget to check 
if her stupid hood was up 
ya big dope?! 
( singsong ): 
Uncle Mike, try not to yell 
in front of her. 
You know we still need her 
to laugh. 
Right. 
( laughs ) 
Hey, Boo, just kidding. Look! 
( gibberish ) 
Funny, right? Huh? 
See what the... 
These are the jokes, kid. 
Whoa! 
What's happening? 
SULLEY: 
Hold on! 
When the door lands 
in this station, cut the power. You'll have the child 
and the criminals responsible 
for this whole mess. 
Great. 
A welcoming committee! 
What are we going to do?! 
Page 65/74
( electrical huooing ) 
( clang ) 
This is the CD A. 
Come out slowly 
with the child 
in plain sight. 
Okay, okay. 
You got us. 
Here we are. 
Here's the kid. 
I'm cooperating. 
But before you take us away, 
I have one thing to say: 
( gags ) 
Catch! 
( all shouting ): 
We have a toxic 
projectile! 
Halt! After the suspect! 
Cover the area! 
Bring in reinforcements! 
WATERNOOSE: 
Stop him! 
( Boo squeaks ) 
Come on. 
Don't let them get away. 
What...?! 
No, wait, wait! 
Come back! 
He has the child! 
( frustrated growl ) 
( Boo squeaks ) 
Sullivan? Sullivan! 
Give me the child! 
Me not go! 
Give her to me! 
( panting ) 
( grunts ) 
( oetallic creaking ) 
WATERNOOSE: 
Open this door! 
Open this door! 
Page 66/74
( growling and pounding ) 
Hey! 
Sullivan! 
( yells ) 
WATERNOOSE: 
Don't do it. 
( beep ) 
Come on. 
Don't go in that room! 
( yelling ) 
I think we stopped him, Boo. 
You're safe now. 
You be a good girl, okay? 
This has gone 
far enough,James. 
She's home now! 
Just leave her alone! 
I can't do that! 
She's seen too much. 
You both have. 
It doesn't have to be this way. I have no choice! 
Times have changed. 
Scaring isn't enough any more. But kidnapping children?! 
I'll kidnap 
a thousand children 
before I let 
this company die 
and I'll silence anyone 
who gets in my way! 
No! 
( child's voice ): 
Good night, Mom. 
( wooan's voice ): 
Good night, sweetheart. 
Good night, Mom. 
What, wh-what is this?! 
What? Who? Huh? 
COMPUTER: 
Simulation terminated. 
Simulation terminated. 
Page 67/74
Well, I don't know 
about the rest of you guys 
but I spotted 
several big mistakes. 
But-but-but how-how did...? 
How did...? 
MIKE: 
You know what? 
Let's watch my favorite part 
again... shall we? 
( repeating ): 
I'll kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die. What...? Wha...? 
I'll kidnap 
a thousand children before... 
( baby talk ) 
Shh, shh, shh, shh! 
Shh! 
I'll get him. 
All right, 
come with us, sir. 
Wh-what are 
you doing? 
Take your 
hands off me! 
You can't arrest me! 
I hope you're happy, Sullivan! You've destroyed this company. Monsters, Incorporated is dead! Where will everyone 
get their scream now?! 
The energy crisis 
will only get worse 
because of you! 
( loud clang ) 
Stay where you are. 
Huh? 
Number One 
wants to talk to you. 
Attention! 
Hello, boys. 
Page 68/74
BOTH: 
Roz?! 
Two and a half years 
of undercover work 
were almost wasted 
when you intercepted 
that child, Mr Sullivan. 
Of course, without your help, 
I never would have known 
that this went all the way up 
to Waternoose. 
( baby talk ) 
( gasps ) 
ROZ: 
Now... 
about the girl... 
I just want to 
send her home. 
Very good. 
( chioing tones ) 
Bring me a door shredder. 
What, you mean... you mean, 
I can't see her again? 
That's the way it has to be. 
I'll give you 
five minutes. 
( whirring hum ) 
Well, so long, kid. 
Mike Wazowski! 
Yeah. 
Ah, Boo, 
it's been fun. 
Go ahead. 
Go grow up. 
( door creaking ) 
( squealing in delight ) 
( laughing ) 
Uh-uh, B-Boo...? 
( speaking baby talk ) 
Um... Boo? 
( speaking baby talk ) 
Oh, look at that. 
Page 69/74
Yeah, you know... 
Oh, that's cute, yeah. 
( baby talk ) 
Uh, Boo, um... 
( squeaking toy ) 
Well, that's very nice. 
( giggling ) 
Come here, you! 
( squeals ) 
( both laughing ) 
Oh, he's a happy bear... 
( giggling ) 
( baby talk ) 
Nothing's coming 
out of your closet 
to scare you 
any more, right? 
Mm... 
Yeah. 
Goodbye, Boo. 
Kitty. 
Kitty has to go. 
Boo! 
( gasps ) 
Kitty? 
( ootor buzzing loudly ) 
( clicks off ) 
None of this 
ever happened, gentlemen. 
And I don't want to see 
any paperwork on this. 
( door closes ) 
Take him away. 
( all ourouring ) 
I bet we get 
the rest of the day off. 
You idiot! 
They're going 
to shut down the factory! 
( all gasp ) 
I'm telling you, pal, 
when that wall went up 
you should have seen the look 
on Waternoose's face. 
Page 70/74
Whoo-hoo! I hope we get 
a copy of that tape. 
Hey, you all right? 
Come on, pal, 
cheer up, we did it! 
We got Boo home. 
Ah, sure, we put the factory 
in the toilet, and... 
gee, hundreds of people 
will be out of work now. 
Not to mention the angry mob 
that'll come after us 
when there's no more power, 
but, hey... 
at least we had 
some laughs, right? 
Laughs... 
( crickets chirping ) 
( wind blowing softly ) 
( door quietly creaks open ) 
( boy gasps ) 
Hey, is this thing on? 
Hello? 
Hello? 
Testing, testing. 
Hey, good evening. 
How are you? 
How are you? 
Nice to see you. 
I tell you, it's good 
to be here in... your room. 
Where you from? 
Never mind. 
You're in 
kindergarten, right? 
Oh, I love kindergarten. 
Best three years of my life. 
Of my life. 
But I love sports. 
Dodgeball was the best. 
Oh, yeah. 
I was the fastest one out there. Course I was the ball. 
But I... 
Page 71/74
was the ball, see? 
All right. 
( ruobling ) 
( ruobling gets louder ) 
( gurgling ) 
Ah... 
( huge burp ) 
Ah? 
( laughing ) 
Hey, thanks a lot. 
I'll be here all week. 
Remember to tip your waitresses. ( guffawing ) 
( rippling gurgle ) 
( bell dings ) 
Great job, Mikey. 
You filled your quota on 
the first kid of the day. 
Not bad, huh? 
You know, only somebody 
with perfect comedic timing 
could produce this much energy in one shot. 
Uh-huh, and the fact 
that laughter is 
ten times more 
powerful than scream 
had nothing to do with it. 
( clears throat ) 
CELIA: 
Oh, Googley Bear. 
Come here, you. 
Schmoopsie-poo! 
Googley. 
Whoa! 
( snakes chittering ) 
( Mike giggling ) 
Girls! 
Girls, put... 
Stop, stop, stop! 
Michael, 
you're such a charmer. 
Hey, did you bring 
Page 72/74
the magazine? 
They just delivered 
a whole box. 
Let me see it! 
( laughing ) 
Sulley and I 
made the cover, right? 
( whispering ): 
I don't believe it. 
( syopathetically ): 
~Googley Bear... 
I'm on the cover 
of a magazine! 
Ow! 
( chattering ) 
( jittering blubbers ) 
Oh, this is great! 
( huooing happily ) 
( child laughing uproariously ) ( bell dings ) 
Oh. 
( distant laughter ) 
( kazoo whirs ) 
( toy horn toots ) 
MIKE: 
Hey, Sulley! 
( yells ) 
Hey, uh, Mike. 
I was, uh, just... 
Well, listen, 
if you got a minute 
there's something 
I want to show you. 
But-but-but... 
Okay, close your eyes. 
Follow me. 
Come on. 
I-I-I... 
No peeking. 
Keep coming, 
keep coming, 
keep coming. 
Page 73/74
Come on, 
keep coming. 
Keep coming, 
keep coming. 
Mike... 
Follow the sultry 
sound of my voice. 
Okay, stop. 
Open them. 
Ta-da! 
Mike... 
is that...? 
Sorry it took 
so long, pal. 
It was a lot of wood 
to go through. 
You know, 
it only works 
if you have 
every piece. 
( whirring hum 
 ) 
( creaking ) 
Boo? 
BOO: 
Kitty!

Survival of the fittest.
It's the law of the jungle.
There's always someone trying
to take what's yours.
How do I know?
It almost happened to me.
Tim Templeton...
quit monkeying around.
Hot dogs are getting cold.
Hot dogs?
At least, this is how I remember it. All right, buddy, let's eat.
You see, I was seven years old... and back then,
you relied on your imagination. When I wasn't exploring the Congo... I was a deep sea diver.
Tim!
Our hero!
Don't worry, Mom and Dad.
I got this!
Grab on!
Some days, I rescued my parents. That way!
Other days, they rescued me.
- I'm losing control.
- Tim, look out!
Tree!
You're breaking up!
Slow down, Tim!
- Turn, Tim.
- Turn!
- Are you hurt?
- I'm okay.
Show Mommy your teeth.
It was just the three of us.
The Templetons.
And three is the perfect number. Interesting fact...
did you know that the triangle is the strongest shape found in nature? I was the luckiest kid ever.
My parents even had cool jobs. Page 2/44

They worked for the biggest pet company in the world...
Puppy Co.
- Yes, Mr. Francis?
- Puppy Co needs you.
It's go time.
They worked in a department
called "Marketing..."
where they got to launch new products. Even though my parents worked really hard... they still made just enough time for me. Three stories, five hugs,
and my special song, right?
You got it!
Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly All your life
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise
Hey, Tim. How would you like
to have a baby brother?
No, thanks. I'm enough.
Life was good. Life was perfect.
But as I drifted off to sleep...
something my parents said got me thinking. Where do babies come from?
The day I got a little brother
started like any other day...
but little did I know...
my life would never be the same.
Wake up, little halflings! It's 7:00 a.m. Wake up, little halflings!
Morning, Wizzie!
What great adventure
lies in wait for you today?
Oh, yeah!
My parents always said
that I had an overactive imagination. But I clearly remember...
the baby was delivered in a taxi.
What the...
Hey!
Tim, look who's here.
Meet your new baby brother.
Page 3/44
Baby what?
Brother.
I had a million questions.
Who is this guy? Why is he here?
What's with that outfit?
Why's he so fat? Why's he staring at me? Does he know karate? What's going on? That way?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Right from the start,
he was yelling at people...
ordering everyone around.
Oh, you want this?
One thing was clear. He was the boss. He set up his office, right
smack dab in the middle of the house. He conducted meetings.
- You called?
- Do you need Seor Squeaky?
Lots and lots of meetings.
Even in the middle of the night.
I'm up! I'm up!
- We're coming!
- We'll be right there!
If things weren't done
to his immediate satisfaction...
he had a fit.
- Where's the bottle?
- He has to have his bottle!
He had everyone wrapped around
his chubby little finger.
Everyone except for me.
- Diaper!
- Bottle!
Dad! I can't sleep.
I know, bud. Me neither.
The baby needs a lot of attention right now. Okay, good talk!
- But...
- It's okay.
Daddy's here. Daddy's here.
What about me?
Page 4/44
The year:
Ensign T-Rex and I are investigating a hostile alien invasion.
It's so much worse than we thought. Mom, he's naked!
I'm naked!
Say "naked."
No!
Who's Mommy's little cutie?
Are you Mommy's little cutie?
No, he's Daddy's little tough guy, right? You know one of us has to go
with Mr. Francis to the pet convention. In Vegas.
- You know what? You should go. - No, no. You should go.
Well, you need a break.
- I'll stay with the baby, and you... - Maybe the baby should decide. Who do you want to stay with you? Daddy or Mommy?
Or Daddy?
He wants his mommy.
Okay, we need to talk!
In private.
- Sure.
- About what, bud?
About the b-a-b-e-e.
"Y," Tim.
Why? Because he came out of nowhere! We don't even know him.
How can we trust him?
Come on, he's just a baby.
Seriously? I'm the only one that thinks there's something weird about this guy? - Oopsie! I got it.
- Five-second rule.
Tim?
Look at him! He wears a suit!
I know. Isn't it cute?
He's like a little man.
He carries a briefcase.
Does no else think that's...
I don't know, a little freaky?
Page 5/44
Well, you carried Lam-Lam around until you were like...
This is not about Lam-Lam.
All babies are different, Tim.
And each one is special.
He's taking over the whole house! Are you taking over the house?
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
Trust me, one day you're gonna
get to know this little guy...
and you are gonna love him
with all of your heart.
Just like we do.
All of your heart?
Never.
Hello!
It's time for my three stories, five hugs, and special song!
How about one story...
three hugs, and my special song? Just my special song?
Mom?
Dad?
Hey.
What happened to bedtime?
We'll have it on Monday, Mr. Francis. Don't cry! Don't cry.
Hello?
Hello? No, ma'am, not yet.
No, I'm not making excuses.
Yes, ma'am,
I know I've been here a long time. Believe me, it feels like my whole life. I'm making great progress
with the parents already.
The usual procedure,
sleep deprivation, hunger strikes. They're very disoriented.
I've got them
eating out of the palm of my hand. They do everything for me.
It's hilarious.
But I think the kid might be on to me. No, I can handle him.
Page 6/44
I know how important this mission is to the company.
Mission?
Well, trust me, ma'am.
You got the right baby for this job. Hands up, devil baby!
Fart! Poop! Doodie!
I've gotta deal with the k-i-d.
You can talk!
Uh, goo-goo Ga-ga.
No, you can really talk. I heard you! Fine. I can talk.
Now, let's see if you can listen. Get me a double espresso...
and see if there's someplace around here with decent sushi.
I'd kill for a spicy tuna roll
right about now.
Get yourself a little something.
Who are you?
Let's just say I'm the boss.
The boss? You're a baby! You wear a diaper. You know who else wears diapers?
Astronauts and NASCAR drivers, that's who. It's called efficiency, Templeton. The average toddler spends, what? 45 hours a year on the potty?
I'm the boss.
I don't have that kind of spare time. Well, you're not the boss of me.
- I am the boss of you.
- No, you're not.
- Am, too.
- Are not.
- Am, too!
- Are not!
- Am, too.
- Are not!
- Am, too.
- Are not!
Am, too. Am, too.
I was here first.
Just wait until Mom and Dad find out about this.
Page 7/44
Oh, yeah? You think they'd pick you over me? With your track record?
You don't know anything about me.
So that's how you wanna play it, huh? Let's see.
Templeton, Timothy. Middle name.... I'm sorry.
Leslie!
- Mostly C's...
- How do you know all that?
Can't ride a bike without training wheels? Even bears can ride a bike
without training wheels, Leslie.
DOB says you're seven.
Seven and a half.
Power nap! You were saying?
I'm seven and a half.
Exactly! You're old.
It's time to make way
for the next generation.
It's the way of the world.
You would never ask your parents
for an old toy.
Lam-Lam?
Everyone wants the hot, new thing. Destroy. Destroy.
- Lam-Lam!
- I've got fresh batteries.
Boom!
Mom and Dad don't even know you.
They love me!
Oh, yeah? Do the math, kid.
There's only so much love to go around. It's like these beads.
You used to have all your parents' love. All their time. All their attention. You had all the beads.
But then I came along.
Babies take up a lot of time.
They need a lot of attention.
They get all the love.
We could share.
You obviously didn't go to business school. Look, Templeton,
Page 8/44

the numbers just don't add up.
There's not enough love for the two of us. Not enough beads to go around.
And then, all of a sudden,
there's no place for Tim.
Tim doesn't fit anymore.
Oh, no! What about Tim?
So keep quiet. Stay out of my way. Or there's gonna be cutbacks.
You can't be fired from your own family. Can you?
Wake up, little halflings! It's 7:00 a.m. Wake up, little half...
What's the use?
Arise for a nutritious breakfast!
It's 7:
What's wrong, Timothy?
Has that little dwarf made you blue? Mm-hmm.
Then I shall cast upon him a great curse! He shall not pass!
It's no use, Wizzie.
He's got Mom and Dad completely fooled. If they knew what I knew,
they'd never let him stay.
Perhaps your parents need to be enlightened. With a great curse!
They shall not pass!
Yeah. I need to enlighten them...
with proof!
That's what I need, proof!
Expose his dark magic!
Testing, testing.
Testing, testing.
Maybe they can return him to the store... and get their money back!
We could buy a bouncy house!
Godspeed, Tim! It's 8:45 a.m.
Ninja.
Ninja.
Ninja.
Ninja.
Babies everywhere! They're spreading. Page 9/44

Mom! Dad! What's going on?
It's an invasion!
It's a play date!
That's a keeper.
It's a meeting, and you won't be attending. We'll see about that.
Thank you all for coming here
on such short notice.
Now, before we begin...
Yes, sir!
- Sure is!
- Affirmative!
Jimbo, run some interference.
Hey!
- We babies are having a crisis!
- Oh, no!
- That's awful!
- Horrible!
What is it?
It's simpler if I just show you.
Teddy, if you please.
Let's put on a show.
Here we go!
Jimbo, hit the lights.
You see, babies aren't getting
as much love as we used to.
Why? Have we been bad?
No, Staci.
But I'll tell you who is.
Behold our mortal enemy. Puppies! No! That's exactly the problem.
Puppies? What's the deal with puppies? Throughout history...
people have loved babies
more than anything in the world.
We've always been a must-have item... number one on every wish list.
Puppies were merely accessories.
But all that changed
when the puppies began coming out... with new designer models.
Each one more adorable than the last. Remember the Labradoodle?
The Peekapoo?
Page 10/44
The Chiweenie?
Try to say "Chiweenie" without smiling. Not possible. Don't waste your time. We all laughed at the Shar Pei.
And now it's number one in China. - Oh, no.
- That's terrible!
- Horrible!
- Yes.
And it gets even worse.
Francis Francis, the CEO of Puppy Co, made this announcement.
Teddy, roll the clip.
And we are on schedule...
to release the most adorable puppy ever. We're gonna launch it
at the pet convention in Las Vegas! Watch out, world!
It's gonna crush the competition! - Yay!
- No, Jimbo.
No "Yay"! We are the competition! This is war.
Puppies are winning, and babies are losing. Thank you, Teddy.
And if this new puppy
is as cute as we fear...
it could put the baby business
out of business, baby.
That's awful!
Bad news, baby!
What are we going to do?
My job is to find out exactly what that new puppy is...
so that Baby Corp can stop it.
And you're going to help me.
- Genius!
- Home run!
You still got it, boss!
Yay!
Yay.
Now, your parents all work for Puppy Co. So have you learned anything from them? - Yes, sir!
Page 11/44
- Sure did!
Fantastic. Triplets, go!
- A.
- B.
- C.
- D.
No, what have you learned
about the new puppy?
Yay, puppy!
No, Jimbo! Puppies are evil.
Staci, read back the notes.
I can't read. What's it say?
This is my team?
A muscle-head, a bunch of yes men, and a doodler?
- Exactly!
- Affirmative!
Good call.
- Oh, yeah!
- Nice one, BB!
Gotcha!
Put that cookie down.
Cookies are for closers.
- Let's have another show!
- No, Teddy!
- How about a hug?
- No more shows!
Boss?
- There's plenty of love to go around. - Go to sleep!
Nighty-night.
- Boss!
- Boss!
- What?
- Parents!
It's like they're having their own little meeting.
- Isn't that adorable?
- Who wants dessert?
God, this is so humiliating.
God, this is so humiliating.
Wait until Mom and Dad hear this. Hey, Templeton, what you got there? Nothing.
Page 12/44
Hand over the tape.
Never!
Mom! Dad! Over here!
- Hi, Timmy!
- Hi! Anyway...
Flower power!
You can't get away from Johnny Law, simpleton.
Fasten your seat belt. Let's go!
Run, run, run.
What? Hey!
Uh-oh.
Run, run, run.
Catch, catch, catch.
Yes!
Oh, yeah!
Let go, you little...
Oh, look! The kids are finally getting along. That's nice.
Sayonara!
You wanna play?
Let's play.
No!
Save Boss! Save Boss!
- Get him!
- I got him!
- I got him!
- I got him!
You're toast, baby man!
Upsies, I need upsies!
Who wants...
Cheese sticks!
Mom, Dad! I've got proof!
Someone can't go down the stairs?
Nothing can stop me!
Mom! Dad! Where are you guys?
Hello?
Where did everyone go?
Mom, Dad! The baby can talk!
Oh, can he now?
Wait, how did you...
Hand over the tape, Timmy.
Or Lam-Lam gets it, see?
No!
Page 13/44
What's that, Lam-Lam? You want a nose ring? It's really not my scene,
but who am I to judge?
And an eyebrow ring?
Seems like a little too much, Lam-Lam. How's that gonna look in a job interview? Stop it!
The tape, Timmy! Or I'm gonna rip, rip, rip. No! Let go!
- You let go!
- You let go!
- Give me the tape!
- Give me Lam-Lam!
Whoops! Too far.
Templeton! Templeton, let's be reasonable. We can be reasonable, right?
What are you doing?
You've been asking for this
since you got here!
We can talk about this over a juice box! Time for juice boxes is over.
No, Templeton. You wouldn't.
Say bye-bye, baby! You're fired!
What are you doing?
Nothing.
My proof!
Tim! Explain yourself!
Yes, explain yourself.
It wasn't me! It was the baby's fault. The baby's fault?
It's true! He can talk.
They all can talk.
They were having a meeting.
There's something about puppies.
It's one big baby con-spy-racy!
Timothy Leslie Templeton!
We are very disappointed in you.
- No, we're mad at you!
- Exactly, we're mad at you.
- Mad?
- You need a time-out!
- You're grounded!
- Yes, grounded!
- For two...
Page 14/44
- Three!
- Three days?
- Weeks!
Weeks! Three weeks!
For three... evers!
Grounded?
You're gonna stay in this house
with your baby brother...
until you learn to get along.
Great.
It was my first time behind bars. The big house.
The lock-up.
Grounded for life.
The minutes turned into hours,
the hours into days.
Every man has his breaking point. This was mine.
Blackbird singing in the dead of night - Take these broken wings and learn to fly - Hey, that's my song.
All your life
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise
It's okay, little halfling.
Perhaps I can be of some assistance. Blackbird singing in the dead of night! Pray, take these broken wings
and learn to fly!
Fly, you fools!
Thanks, Wizzie.
But it's not the same.
If only I could reach my magical shank. I could break us out of this big house. Templeton!
Templeton, we have to talk.
Go away.
Blackbird singing in the dead of night Stop it!
That's my song, not yours.
My parents wrote it just for me. Really?
Your parents are Lennon and McCartney? No, Ted and Janice.
Page 15/44
You don't even know their names!
You're just trying to steal them from me. You stole everything!
You're the one who should be in jail! Look, it's time we put our differences aside. Have you been...
No!
Where's HR when you need them?
Take it.
I don't want your filthy money.
Look, I told you to stay out of my way. I can't! You're in my house.
I don't wanna be here...
any more than you want me to be here. Then why are you torturing me?
The truth is I'm no ordinary baby. Well, no kidding.
I'm on a mission from above.
Are you the Baby Jesus?
Yes. I'm the Baby Jesus.
No!
You see, I'm more middle management for the company.
The company? What company?
Here.
Take this. It'll explain everything. What do you want me to do with that? - I want you to suck it.
- You suck it!
No, it's for you to suck.
I'm not sucking that!
- Suck it.
- I don't know where it's been!
It's not where it's been.
It's where it will take you.
Don't you wanna know...
where babies really come from?
Binky. Papish. Nuk-Nuk.
Boo-Boo. Bo-Bo. Bah-Bah.
Chupie. Hushie-Baby. Tootsie.
It goes by many names.
But through its power,
you will know the truth.
Come on, faster!
Page 16/44
Mommy!
Where are we?
Welcome to Baby Corp!
No way.
- Thank you.
- What?
Relax. They can't see us or hear us. - We're, like, virtual and stuff?
- Yep.
- You mean they won't feel this?
- Nope.
- Or this?
- Nada.
Karate!
Don't embarrass yourself, Templeton. I can still see you.
So this is where babies come from? Where'd you think, the cabbage patch? Magic fairies?
No, my parents told me that...
What?
No. That's disgusting.
Yeah, it didn't sound right to me, either. I can't believe
my parents didn't tell me about this. If people knew where babies really came from, they'd never have one.
Same thing with hot dogs, by the way. Going upsies!
So how come I don't remember this place? You did.
But after normal babies
get their pacifiers taken away...
you forget all about Baby Corp.
How come you're not normal?
A few of us, the best of the best... are selected for the...
For the ultimate honor.
Upper management.
This, Templeton, is where all the action is. Nap time in Sector G.
So this whole place is run by babies? Yep.
My Dad says, "Those who can, do."
Page 17/44
"And those who can't, supervise." Your father is a hippy.
What happens when you grow up?
We don't.
We drink a super-secret baby formula that keeps us babies forever.
Back to work! Formula break is over! We're in a crisis here!
Don't you know we're in a crisis here? Who is that?
That is my boss. Big Boss Baby.
What is she screaming about?
Well, see this pie chart?
Wow, it looks like a giant pie.
It represents all the love there is in the world.
- I love pie.
- Who doesn't?
- Apple.
- Fine.
- No, cherry!
- Perfect!
- Not pumpkin.
- Okay.
That's a vegetable.
Point is, the puppies' slice
is getting bigger and bigger.
They're stealing all our love!
Just like you did to me.
Exactly.
And if this keeps up...
there might not be enough pie left for babies.
No pie?
No pie.
So, my mission is to find out
what this new puppy is.
So you're, like, on a spy mission? Cool! Yes! Cool! And if... When I succeed... I'll become a Baby Corp legend.
Like Super Big Boss Baby, Mega Boss Baby... Seriously Big Boss Baby...
and him.
Now that's a big, fat baby.
Page 18/44
No, that's Big Fat Boss Baby.
This is Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby. He was the youngest Chief Executive Infant in the history of the company.
Was? What happened to him?
Retired, years ago.
But I still try and live up to his legend. In every situation, I ask myself... "W-W-S-C-B-F-B-B-D?
"What Would Super Colossal
Big Fat Boss Baby Do?"
So that's all you get?
Your picture on the wall?
Come here!
I'll get a promotion.
The corner office...
with my own private potty.
Wow.
So when you're done, you're coming back here? A-S-A-P, T-i-m.
I'm not a family man. I belong behind a desk. - That's awesome!
- I know, right?
- Pew pew.
- What?
So help me,
I will nail his diaper to the wall! Have we heard anything
from that little Boss Baby...
that we sent down to the Templetons? - I don't know.
- You're fired!
Oh, no.
You're all fired!
The pet convention is in two days. If he doesn't come up with answers... he is fired, retired!
- Gone!
- Tour's over.
What was Big Bossy Baby Lady screaming about? She's demanding actual results.
The pet convention is in two days, and I've got nothing!
That's her! Don't answer it!
Page 19/44
Stress nap!
If I don't find out
what that new puppy is and fast... not only will I not get that promotion... I could get fired!
Hey, relax.
I'm sure there's other cool jobs
for babies, right?
Meanwhile, two days goes by like that. You better start packing.
What?
You don't get it, Templeton.
If I'm fired, they'll take away my formula. I will turn into a normal baby... and live here forever with you.
- No!
- Yes!
And I promise you this...
Every morning you wake up...
I'll be there.
Every night, at dinner...
I'll be there.
Every birthday party...
I'll be there.
Every Christmas!
I'll be there
Year after year after year.
We will grow old together.
You and I...
will be brothers.
Always.
- No. No, this is terrible!
- I know.
- This can't be happening.
- But it is!
- You can't stay here!
- I can't!
- Don't panic!
- But it feels right!
I know, but we have to fix this.
We have to make sure you don't get fired. We?
We.
I will help you...
Page 20/44

but just to get rid of you.
Deal?
Deal.
Here's to never seeing you again.
Back at ya, baby.
Now let's get to work.
Come on, come on, come on.
Slice!
No, no.
There's nothing here about a new puppy. Aren't you gonna do any work?
I'm very busy delegating.
He drains it!
So once we find the file on the new puppy... what do we do then?
Send in the baby ninjas?
Even better.
I'm going to write the perfect memo. - Boom!
- Boom!
Wait. What's a memo?
A memo is something you write
to give people information.
That's your plan?
You're gonna write a book report?
That's so boring.
No, Templeton.
Memos are for important things.
A memo can bring people together.
A memo can be a call to arms...
a manifesto, a poem.
A memo can change the world.
Wow! When you explain it like that... it still sounds boring.
You'll learn, kid.
You'll learn.
Wait a second. This is it!
What? What is it?
Check this out. Take Your Kid to Work Day. People take children
to a place of business? Why?
Because it's awesome!
It's disgusting.
Don't you see? We can get inside Puppy Co... Page 21/44

and find out what the new puppy is! What's the point?
You're grounded.
Your parents aren't
going to take us anywhere.
You're right. They think we hate each other. Hate is a strong word.
It's the right word, but still.
We have to convince them
that we're actual brothers.
Right.
That we...
Loathe?
No.
Like!
No. That we...
La, la, la...
Le, Le, Le...
No.
No way. No. You don't mean...
Love each other.
I just threw up a noodle and swallowed it. - Here comes the choo-choo train!
- No.
- Choo, choo, chugga, chugga.
- No choo-choo!
Hold the train! No!
It looks like it's already been eaten! Who's there? I got a racket!
What's going on in here?
I'm just feeding the baby.
They're watching.
Choo-choo.
Okay.
Choo-choo on that.
I don't wear nautical. It's not even Friday! Come on, you're putting this thing on! You gonna make me? You can't make me, punk. - What have you done to me?
- Stop!
- Get back here!
- No!
No way.
Come on!
Page 22/44
Tim, what are you doing in here?
Oh, no.
Hey, what's all the racket?
Isn't he adorable?
I've got one for you, too! Ahoy, matey! What?
Bummer.
Smile!
Smile for the camera.
It makes me feel weak.
- Who's ticklish?
- It doesn't work on me.
- Here?
- I'm dead down there.
Come on, everyone has a tickle spot. "'I don't think I'll fit,' said Gretel." Come here, look at this.
"'I could get in myself.'
"And then, Hansel and Gretel...
"pushed the wicked old woman into the oven. "And the godless witch
was miserably burnt to death."
Let me get this straight.
The story is about cannibalism
and burning people alive.
Yeah.
No wonder kids are so messed up!
Getting along is exhausting.
Back at ya, Tim.
You should have seen your face
in that picture.
You were all...
I'm not used to being tickled.
Once at a corporate retreat.
But those things always get weird. What? You've never been tickled?
What about your parents?
I'm sorry. I forgot.
You didn't have parents, did you? Tim, I may look like a baby...
but I was born all grown up.
I can't even imagine not being a kid. You missed out on your whole childhood? You never had someone to love you?
Page 23/44

You can't miss what you never had. Wake up, little halflings!
Hey, Tim. Wake up, buddy.
- What?
- Rise and shine!
Is something wrong? Am I fired?
No, you're late for work.
What?
It's Take Your Kid to Work Day!
And you're the kid.
You're officially un-grounded.
- Really?
- Really.
Can the baby come, too?
I don't see why not.
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!
Yeah!
I wish I was that excited for work. Look, it's my spatula.
Yeah, baby.
All right, gentlemen. Welcome to Puppy Co. Wow! This is awesome!
And Tim, look!
They have a puppy pool and everything! Isn't that sanitary?
Hey, bud, you wanna get a picture
with Puppy Co Pete?
No, thanks.
It's probably too scary for the baby. Nice call.
Your dad and I have some work to do. You wanna come up to the office
and hang out with us?
We'll stick your brother in the Puppy Zone... while we have a little Tim time.
Tim time?
Dad and I know we haven't been able to do as much with you as we used to. So, what do you say?
No, thanks.
I'd rather spend time with the baby. - So cute.
- That's so sweet.
Way to keep your eyes on the prize, Page 24/44

Templeton.
We find out what the new puppy is, and I go home.
You guys stay in the Puppy Zone, okay? Okay, bye!
That's where we'll find
the secret file on the new puppy.
We'll never get through that door. No, not that door.
The doggy door.
But how do we get past the guard?
No, no, no. No way.
No!
Itchy, plushy, puppy pants!
What a cute, little pup...
Ow!
Yay!
Kids.
Get down.
All the way down.
I've never been so humiliated in all my life. Arf!
Hey!
Fetch!
What am I doing?
Oh, no!
Yes!
What a good boy.
No. No biting.
Timothy Templeton, office ninja.
- Over here.
- What is it?
It's gotta be in here.
It's begging us to go in.
Wow.
That's a lot of paperwork.
I thought puppies shredded everything. This is getting creepy.
I've come for your soul.
Cut it out!
Wait!
That's it!
The file!
See! I was right.
Page 25/44
No. I've seen this before somewhere. We've gotta find something
to replace it with.
You're right. Like another file. Yes! A file with the same weight. So it can be placed
in the exact same position.
- With the exact same weight.
- You already said that.
I know I said it. Hey, you hit me twice. Make it a third time. Wait!
I think I've seen one here.
Smead manila, pressboard edges.
About 50 ounces. No, 49.
Try this one.
Wait!
Now it's perfect.
Yes!
I feel like we should run.
I know, but it's just so mesmerizing. I kind of wanna see how it ends. Yeah, me too.
Well, that didn't end well.
What?
What the...?
Thanks for dropping in, kids.
Francis Francis?
I see you've met my big brother, Eugene. A man of few words.
None, in fact.
Can you put your head back on, please? What is all this?
Surprise!
A Baby Corp binky? Where did you get that? You don't recognize me?
Perhaps from my youth!
Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby? He is him? And him is you?
Except older and wrinklier.
That's not right.
No. You were my hero!
How did you end up here?
You know what I do to little kids who ask lots of questions about me?
Page 26/44
Eugene!
I read them my story.
And, I baked cookies!
Eugene, my chair.
Now, it all started at Baby Corp... a long, long time ago.
I was a hotshot executive...
headed straight to the top.
Everyone loved me.
They gave me a promotion,
the corner office...
my very own...
Personal potty?
I had it all.
But then one day...
I made a terrible discovery.
I was getting old.
The formula wasn't working anymore. It turns out I was lactose intolerant. - No!
- Yes!
I got called in
to see the board of directors.
Who are the boring directors?
The biggest baby bosses of them all. I thought they loved me.
But they replaced me with someone new. Someone younger.
That's horrible.
All of a sudden, she got all the love... all the attention.
You know how that feels, don't you, Tim? It hurts, doesn't it?
Yeah. It does.
And then what happened?
Well...
They fired me!
And took away my special formula. Then they sent me down to live with a... - family!
- Oh, Francis, no!
Baby Corp betrayed me!
And I'm finally going to get revenge... with the Forever Puppy.
Page 27/44
- Huh?
- That's it?
No, no.
Imagine a puppy that never grows up. A puppy that stays a puppy forever. Once I launch my Forever Puppies
to every corner of the world...
they'll be so adorable...
How cute!
...no one will ever want a baby
ever, ever again.
The end of Baby Corp!
Please.
A puppy that never grows up?
That's impossible!
Isn't it?
It was, until you brought me
the key ingredient.
My secret formula.
It's mine! It's mine!
It's all mine.
No!
You brought me the very thing I needed to destroy Baby Corp.
- No!
- Yes!
You walked right into my trap!
- You'll never get away with this! - Yeah, not if we...
What? Tell?
Who are you gonna tell, Tim? Your parents? Where are the boys?
I told them to stay in the Puppy Zone. I'm taking them both with me to Las Vegas. So stay out of my way.
I'd hate for them to get terminated. They'd never leave us alone.
Oh, really?
Wait until they meet Puppy Co's certified... in-house childcare expert.
Oh, no.
- Don't be nervous, buddy.
- It's only overnight.
We'll be back before you know it.
Page 28/44
Besides, you boys are in great hands. That's right!
Eugenia is practically perfect in every way. No.
Please don't go with him.
Francis Francis is trying to...
Believe me...
Eugenia won't take her eyes
off your children.
Not for one second.
That's very reassuring.
Now you see them.
And now, you don't.
Too-da-loo!
To the airport!
It's over. I'm through.
What do we do, Templeton?
What do we do?
We have to get to the airport
and stop Francis Francis...
before the plane takes off!
Yes! But how do we get past
Scary Poppins down there?
Okay. There must be something we can do. Hey, it's not that bad.
Are you okay?
What's the matter with you?
Don't look at me!
Oh, no!
Without that formula,
I turn into a normal baby.
You know, goo-goo, Ga-ga. The whole bit! Oh, no!
Gross!
I'm a ticking baby time bomb!
I'm going to turn into a puking,
pooping, helpless baby!
Wait a second. That gives me an idea. What? What is it?
I've been through a lot of babysitters... and they all fear one thing.
Now, ladies,
the secret to deep fried butter... is a healthy dab of margarine.
Page 29/44
Hey, Mr. Lady Man!
The baby. I think he's sick!
You gotta do something!
Oh, the horror!
- Templeton!
- Delicious!
Gross! It got in your mouth!
It got in my mouth, too!
I think I'm gonna be sick!
Swirly!
There's only an hour
before the plane takes off.
Let's take the bike.
The bike?
I don't know.
Let's move!
- Okay, but wait right here!
- What?
Where are you going? Templeton! Always wear a helmet.
Too-da-loo, toilet head!
You'll never catch us!
Staci!
Staci, come in!
Oh, Staci!
- Is that you, boss?
- Code red!
I'm being chased by a killer babysitter! Gather the team!
On it, boss.
- Hello!
- Hello!
- Hello!
- Code red.
Got it!
We got a code red. Repeat...
We got a code red!
What are you doing, Templeton? Go, go! But that's jaywalking!
Here, I'll pay your ticket.
Go!
I think we lost him!
Oh, no, we didn't!
Flower power!
Page 30/44

Pow, pow, pow!
That's my boy!
Poppy!
Run, run, run.
Uh-oh.
Run, run, run.
Tim, you've gotta go faster!
I can't do it!
You can.
You've got it in you, Templeton.
Now, eyes ahead.
I said eyes ahead, son!
Buttocks up! Now pedal like you mean it! Either you run the day, or the day runs you. Good!
Uh-oh!
My training wheels!
I can't ride without training wheels! Whether you think you can
or you think you can't, you're right! What are you talking about?
The path to success
is not a straight line, Templeton... but rather a wild ride...
like a ship at sea.
And you're a sea captain...
taming a turbulent ocean!
I'm a sea captain, taming the ocean! Good!
Tree! I'm gonna hit it!
Aim for failure, and you'll always succeed. - What?
- Aim away from failure!
I'm doing it. I'm doing it!
Once success is a habit...
then it's all downhill.
Look!
There they are! Mom, Dad!
- Train!
- Choo-choo!
Stop!
What are you doing?
- We're gonna make it.
- But I don't have a quote for this! Page 31/44

You did it!
No! We did it.
And all without your training wheels. Coming through!
Baby on board!
Hang on to your diaper!
Duck and cover!
Hold it, buddy!
I'm gonna need a strip search on two. There they are! Mom, Dad!
Hey, not so fast!
Oh, no.
Templeton!
- Hey!
- Sorry!
Hey, where'd you go?
Oh, no!
Not again!
Not now!
What the...?
No, no, no!
Come on!
I think I ate $1.75.
Excuse me, coming through! Mom, Dad! Hurry now! Move!
We don't wanna miss our flight!
- No!
- I warned you!
Wait!
- No!
- No.
Mom, Dad! Stop!
No!
No, no, no.
They're gone.
I failed.
I would've gotten to my parents
if I didn't have to go back for you! What? We would have been here
in plenty of time...
if you knew how to ride a bike
like a normal kid!
We're never going to stop the launch on time. Who cares? My parents are in danger.
Page 32/44
I care! Baby Corp is going to go
out of business.
That's all you ever talk about.
You don't even know what it's like to be part of a family.
And you don't know what it's like to have a job!
You don't know anything about hugs, or bedtime stories, or special songs! Oh, please! Stop acting like a baby. You're a baby!
You take that back.
My life was perfect until you showed up! Believe me, kid, the feeling is mutual. I wish I'd never met you!
I wish you'd never been born!
Where are you going?
Fine!
Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly All your life
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise
Would Timothy Templeton please pick up the white courtesy phone?
Timothy Leslie Templeton,
please pick up the white courtesy phone. Leslie.
Hello?
It's me. Don't hang up, Tim!
Tim, I wasn't born. I was hired.
What do you mean?
Baby Corp is the only home I've ever known. So you're right.
I don't know what it's like...
to be part of a family.
But I do care.
You do?
Yeah.
And the only way to save both
is to stop Francis Francis.
Yeah.
I can't do this without you, Tim. I need you.
Page 33/44
- I guess we do make a pretty good team. - No.
Literally, I can't reach the door knobs. Oh, right.
Don't worry, Tim.
We're gonna save your parents.
And your company.
But how do we get to Vegas now?
We're gonna need a miracle.
Follow that Elvis!
Why?
Where there's Elvis, there's Vegas! There's another one!
And another one!
Elvises everywhere!
Tim, there's our flight!
And there goes our ticket!
Hey! Don't be cruel!
Sorry!
- Well, thank you!
- Oh, baby!
Well, thank you very much.
Hello.
Hi.
Ticket please.
One moment.
It's been stolen!
Impersonating an Elvis impersonator? Get him!
Humina, humina, humina.
Stop!
The ghost of Elvis!
We gotta find seats!
Come on, this way!
What is this place?
This, Templeton, is first class.
Why is it empty?
No one can afford it.
That's what makes it so wonderful. Hello! This is Captain Ross.
Ladies and gentlemen, and those in coach... please fasten your seat belts.
We're about to take off.
What's the matter, Templeton?
Page 34/44
My parents always hold my hand
during takeoff.
Boy, the stocks are crazy today.
Ladies and gentlemen, Captain Ross again. As you can see,
I've switched off the seat belt sign. What are you two boys doing up here? We're Captain Ross's kids.
He told us to sit here.
Well, can I get you special guys anything? Anything?
Anything.
Aye! All right, Francis Francis.
This will teach you
to kidnap the parents of One-Eyed Tim. Oh, please. If only it were that easy. What's your plan?
You're not gonna write a memo, are you? No.
Come on. You said you never really had a childhood, right?
Why don't you give it a try?
- No, I can't.
- It's fun!
Here, let's get you into character. I don't know. I feel silly!
Go on! Say something mean to him. All right, all right, all right.
So, you went to a community college, is it? I don't know.
Keep going!
And you have the guts
to ask me for a bonus, now?
See!
Now you're getting into it.
Huh?
Well, blow me down.
Your exit interview is over!
That was pretty good.
Who was that guy anyway?
- The captain!
- What?
En garde!
Heave!
Page 35/44

Ho!
Thar she blows!
Watch your stern!
- Aye!
- Dodge, parry, and thrust!
Sounds like a heck of a law firm! Nice try! Heads up!
You're fired!
And here's your severance package. Ha! Wait. You're not supposed to end with "Ha!" You're not?
You're supposed to end with "Argh!" Got it! Argh!
That's great!
Thanks! I just went with the flow. Ladies and gentlemen, and those in coach... on the left side of the plane...
you can see we're approaching
fabulous Las Vegas.
Land ho!
Ahoy, matey.
Bye, Dad! Thanks for the lift!
- Okay. What?
- Let's move.
- Going to the Heartbreak Hotel?
- I'm going to the Heartbreak Hotel. - Me, too!
- Me, too!
Me, too!
We've gotta get to the convention center. Should we get a taxi?
Darn! I spent all my per Diem.
That's more our speed.
Right.
Excuse me, ladies.
Can we get a ride home?
Jimmy's been sick,
and he needs his expensive medicine. Where do you live, sweetie?
The convention center.
Bye, sweetie!
Have a fun lady party!
Chicks dig babies.
The people of Long Island do not know Page 36/44
how to make an iced tea.
Oh, no! How are we gonna find my parents in here?
Tim!
Over there.
Okay, now where's Puppy Co?
Puppy Co, Puppy Co, Puppy Co...
Aha! Here it is. Found it!
But how did you...?
Hey! Where'd you go?
Not again!
Come on! I need you!
I'm back! I'm back.
What's going on?
That's right.
We're gonna launch a brand new puppy in every continent.
In every country!
We're going to take over the world, one heart at a time.
- Tim, there they are!
- Mom, Dad!
Imagine a puppy that never grows up... never gets old.
A puppy that stays a puppy forever. I give you the only thing you'll ever love... the Forever Puppy!
Mommy?
Avert your eyes, Templeton!
Hey! What are you doing here?
Mom, Dad!
What are they doing here?
What are Tim and the baby doing here? What are any of us doing here, really? What is going on here?
He's got my parents!
We're really here to get them.
Get them!
Get the Forever Puppy!
We've got to get backstage.
In there!
Run!
Go, go, go!
Left, right! Left, right! Left, right! Page 37/44

Yes!
Fart. Poop. Doodie.
Look at all that formula.
Now that's how you launch a product. Oh, no!
He's putting them under the rocket! Elvis has left the building!
Mom, Dad...
I'm coming!
Atta boy! Go, Tim! Go, go!
Launch initiated.
I'm launching my Forever Puppies,
and there's nothing you can do about it! No!
Baby Corp stole all the love from me... and now I'm going to take it back from them. You should understand what I'm talking about. You got replaced just like me!
No! I'm nothing like you!
Bratty kid!
Let our parents go! His parents. The parents. Yeah!
You could have had your parents' love all to yourself again!
But no!
You blew it!
You let that baby boss you around. He doesn't work for me.
We're partners!
I'm not ticklish.
Hey! Where's the baby?
Everyone has a tickle spot!
My ears!
Stop it!
Little brats!
Nothing is going to get in the way of my vengeance.
Not you, not anybody!
Baby Corp is through.
I win! Ha!
Wrong!
You're not supposed to end with "Ha!" - That's right!
- What?
Page 38/44
You're supposed to end with... Argh!
En garde!
You're fired!
And here's your severance package! Take that, you scurvy scallywag! Argh!
One minute and counting.
- Help!
- Anybody!
Tim! What are you doing?
No!
Mom, Dad, I'm coming!
Is that you?
Don't worry, Mom and Dad. I got this! - Are you okay?
- Is the baby all right?
Yes, the baby's fine.
Who was that?
That was me!
The baby's fine.
It won't budge!
What's happening?
Wait a second!
Hey.
I know a way to move my parents. - How?
- We can use the puppies!
Upsies.
I need upsies.
But what if you "go baby" again? It'll be fine. Fine, fine.
Fine!
It'll be fine.
Hang on to your diaper!
We're moving!
Why are we moving?
All right, Mom and Dad, hang on! T-minus 30 seconds.
Oh, no! Wait!
Hold on!
Go, Tim! Get your parents...
out of here.
You've gotta jump!
Page 39/44
Come on, it's a piece of cake!
No! No patty cake! Get down!
Don't cry. I'm sorry. Please don't cry! 20 seconds.
15 seconds.

You were only waiting
For this moment to arise
- Three...
- Gotcha!
...two, one.
Blast off!
Yeah!
Hey, are you still in there?
Aha!
What happened? Did we win?
- We won!
- We won?
- We won, we won, we won!
- We won! Yes!
Victory nap!
You ruined everything!
It's not fair! It's not fair!
That's not right.
Now you're really going to pay! Oh, yeah? It's time you pick on someone your own size!
What?
Eugene! You put me down!
You hear me? I am the boss of you! This time, we'll raise him right. I'm sure that's gonna turn out fine. Tim, what's happening?
Mom, Dad, hold on!
Yes!
- Tim?
- Tim!
Tim! Are you okay?
I'm fine. We're fine.
You saved us.
You're our hero.
And a great big brother.
Page 40/44

We love you both so much.
Both of us?
With all our heart.
Let's go home.
How do I look?
You look great.
Well, team, good job.
Staci, this letter should get you into the school of your choice. - Kindergarten?
- That's right.
And if there's anything else... How about a raise?
Staci, you don't get paid.
- One million ziggity-five!
- Eight!
- A tricycle!
- Skates!
- Candy corn?
- Lollipop!
Deal.
Best boss ever.
And you guys don't always have to toe the company line, you know? It's okay to think for yourself. - No, sir!
- No way!
That's a terrible idea!
That's the attitude.
- You're so right!
- You've got it, sir!
- You're the man!
- Absolutely!
Here you go, big guy.
You've earned it.
You wanna hug me, don't you?
I'll miss you too, buddy. Okay. - There, there.
- It'll be okay, big guy.
So...
you did it.
No. We did it.
By the way,
congratulations on your promotion. Page 41/44
The corner office, the private potty. All that stuff.
But, hey! How about you?
You have your parents all to yourself. So what am I gonna tell Mom and Dad after you leave?
Don't worry.
Baby Corp has a procedure
for situations like this.
It'll be like I was never born. I almost forgot!
No way! Lam-Lam!
- You fixed her.
- Yep.
She's as good as new. She's a tough one. Well, I guess we both got what we wanted. It's a win-win.
Probably should...
Yeah.
So, stay in school.
I don't really have a choice.
Yeah, right.
- Goodbye, Tim.
- Bye.
Yeah, right.
He left as suddenly as he arrived. Bye.
Finally, my life was perfect again. Forget about the baby.
Oopsies!
Pardon me, big fella.
Surprise!
Hooray!
Forget about the baby?
No, thanks. I'm good.
Okie-dokie.
Argh.
Dear Boss Baby...
I don't usually write very much... but now I know
that memos are very important things. Even though I never went
to business school...
I did learn to share in kindergarten. Page 42/44

And if there isn't enough love
for the two of us...
then I wanna give you all of mine. I would like to offer you a job.
It will be hard work...
and there will be no pay.
But the good news is that
you can never be fired.
And I promise you this.
Every morning when you wake up,
I will be there.
Every night at dinner, I will be there. Every birthday party,
every Christmas morning...
I will be there.
Year after year after year.
We will grow old together.
And you and I will always...
...be brothers.
Always.
Wake up, little halflings! It's 7:00 a.m. What's the point, Wizzie?
Because it's 7:
I have one job to do,
and you make it so difficult.
It's okay, little halfling.
Sometimes, I get confused too.
Especially during daylight savings time. Spring forward, fall back.
We don't even have calendars
in the wizard's realm!
There is no spring, only darkness and winter! I'm not confused at all, Wizzie.
I just miss him.
Tim, look who's here!
It's your new baby...
Brother!
You're here! You're really here!
Gentle, gentle.
You came back!
Say hello to Theodore Lindsey Templeton. Lindsey?
Who's ticklish? Who's ticklish?
Page 43/44
Here you go.
So, that's my story.
Our story.
Luckily for me and my little brother, it had a happy ending.
Is that a true story, Daddy?
Well, sweetie, that's how I remember it. - But you know what I found out? - What?
There's plenty of love for everyone. Even me?
Especially you.
Just ask your Uncle Ted.
Hey, kid, I hear you're gonna have a baby sister.
I wanted a horse.
Here you go, kid. Go get yourself a horse. You know, I'm proud of you, Leslie. Back at ya, Lindsey.
Hi there, baby sister.
Argh!
All right, guys.
Time for bed.
Come on, Mom. Just a little longer. Okay.
Wake up, little halflings!
It's time to leave.
Go and live your peasant lives.
Be gone with you!

Page 1/23
We will not be able to go anywhere
There is no route from here.
This journey was hopeless.
We can only go this far.
Let's give up.
There is a way.
Let's believe in it.
We will surely be able to find it.
But, Princess...
Don't give up!
Princess...
Princess Fuun!
You bastards will not be able | to go any further than this. Mao!
You bastrad!
Don't tell me that you're the one who caused this storm! Watch out, Princess Fuun!
You should give up.
You should beg for forgiveness, Princess Fuun.
I will never give up.
As long as I live,
I will turn everything that I have into strength,
and I will show that I can cut a way open!
The princess is...
The seven color chakra is burning.
Let's go! We shall also burn our chakra!
Yes!
Alright!
Alright!
That's the way, well done, Princess Fuun!
As I thought, justice will always triumph!
Hey! What are you doing up there?!
Ow ow ow ow ow! Geez!
What do you want all of a sudden?
What do you mean what do I want?
Sneaking in and watching the movie | for free is completely unethical. No, it's not like that.
We weren't just watching the movie, | we were training at the same time. Training?
Our tickets are right here.
Are you guys Konoha ninja?
Heh, that's right!
I will one day be the super ninja to claim the | Hokage name, Uzumaki Naruto-sama!
Page 2/23
I am...
You're noisy!
Be considerate!
Shut up!
Well then, let's go...
... beyond that rainbow!
NARUTO:
NARUTO | The Big Mission to Rescue the Snow Princess!
(On poster:
Kakashi-sensei sure is late.
It's always like this.
Geez, that movie was so good.
I was so overwhelmed by it.
What are you saying?!
Because you created such an uproar, | we didn't get to watch the end.
(On door:
Oh well, I should have atched Michi-sama, the | guy who played Tsukuyaku, more carefully.
Ah, but of course, you're number one, Sasuke-kun.
Sakura-chan has bad taste in men, as always.
What did you say?!
No, nothing really.
Oh really?
I wonder if there are any princesses like Princess Fuun around here. Any ninja would be satisfied to fight for a princess like that. What nonsense.
It's just a story from a movie.
But then, I wonder why Kakashi-sensei told | us to watch this movie before the mission.
No way! Princess Fuun!
Follow her!
Don't let her get way!
I will protect Princess Fuun!
Now!
We finally caught you.
Who are you, bastard?
Oh my, my.
Kakashi-sensei!
What are you guys doing?
Just wasting time.
I'm sorry.
Page 3/23
What?
This person is the client for this mission.
Are you hurt, Princess?
Oh wow, you really are Princess Fuun!
You know, when I watched your movie, I was so moved!
"Don't give up."
I was about to cry until I couldn't stop.
When I saw your movie, I was motivated.
I won't ever give up.
I will try harder, and I'll become Hokage.
Ah, by the way, the Hokage is the ninja in the village of Konoha. You're really good at riding.
As expected from the Fire Country's most famous actress! Hey, miss, you're going a bit too fast!
Watch out!
It's Princess Fuun!
Wow! Great!
It's really Princess Fuun!
I am not Princess Fuun.
I know, you are the actress Fujikaze Yukie.
I'm a fan of yours!
Please sign!
Me too!
I don't give autographs or anything like that.
Please don't say that, please?
Please sign.
Me too! Give me an autograph!
Since you're an actress, please at least give me an autograph! Cut it out!
What's so fun about getting my autograph?
Sooner or later, you will put it away somewhere | and then it will collect dust.
It doesn't serve a purpose and it's useless.
It's so stupid.
That's so rude of her.
Oh my, that's so disappointing.
Just because she's making it big doesn't | mean that she can be bitchy. This time, our mission is to protect the actress | that plays Princess Fuun, Fukikaze Yukie.
Protect?
Well, protect may not be the right word. | It's better to say we're her escorts.
This will be the first time that The Unlucky | Princess will be filmed overseas.
Page 4/23
But Fujikaze Yukie plays the most critical role.
I am really sorry...
As one would expect from Konoha ninja...
...the bodyguards that were hired as stuntmen,
and even our master guards were easily beaten.
Thank you very much for you compliment.
Wow, what beautiful cliffs.
Those are the Snow Country's rainbow glaciers.
You're Kin-chan, the actor who played Brit!
This time, the last scene of the movie will be fimed there. And you're Hideo-san, the actor who played Shishimaru!
We sure are going far if we're going to the Snow Country. That was the manager, Sandayuu-san's, recommendation.
It is said that in Spring the rainbow glaciers glow with seven colors. But that is nothing more than a myth.
In the real Snow Country, there is no such thing as Spring. No Spring?
Does that mean that it's always winter?
That's what it mean.
Kakashi, was it?
I heard that you'd been to the Snow Country before.
It was long ago.
And it is said that the Snow Country is a poor nation.
It-It's the henchman, Michi-sama!
Didn't their economy collapse because the previous feudal | lord got too involved with his mechanical puppets?
And that's how they went bankrupt, or something like that? Hey, I hope that they have a heater at least.
I don't really like to go to cold places.
So, do you wanna run away, just like Yukie?
Hey, give me a break!
Is Yukie-san, erm... always like that?
Well, yes.
She doesn't know the meaning of words like "motivation" or "ambition", and she is really quite helpless, that Yukie-chan...
But she doesn't slack off when it comes to work.
I don't care about an actor's private life.
As long as she gives a great performance when | the camera is on, I'm not going to complain.
She was born to be an actress.
Thinking about it, she started running away when she | was told that she was going to the Snow Country.
Okay, I give up.
Alright!
Page 5/23
Your name is?
Uzumaki Naruto!
Yeah, yeah... Uzumaki Naruto-san, right?
Miss, you smell nice.
What was that?!
Pervert repellent.
How stupid.
Quit joking around.
Who would want to go to the Snow Country?
I finally found you, Princess Fuun!
I told you already, I'm not Princess Fuun.
I understand that!
How dare you break a boy's pure heart?!
It doesn't matter how great of an actress | you are, I will never forgive you!
Actress?
Great?
How stupid.
Being an actress is the worst job ever.
It's a job for the worst people.
You have to follow other people's scripts, | act, and live in a world packed with lies.
Truly stupid.
Lady, are you drunk?
You're annoying, hurry up and disappear!
Yukie-sama!
The ship to the Snow Country is departing soon!
We'd better hurry, or else...
It's okay.
I am not going to board.
Eh? What?!
What are you saying?!
It'll be alright.
It happens all the time.
Something goes wrong, the main character | gets replaced, the director gets replaced...
Be quiet!
The part of Princess Fuun can only be played by you!
And if you aren't going to come, you are not going | to be able to work in this business again.
It's alright, it doesn't matter.
Yukie-sama.
I guess it can't be helped.
I see. So she has the hexagonal crystal.
Page 6/23
The actress Fujikaze Yukie is undoubtedly Kazahana Koyuki. Ten years of searching is finally paying off.
If it was just the girl, it would be too easy.
But Koyuki seems o have an escort, Hatake Kakashi.
Hatake Kakashi?
Eh? That sounds interesting.
Sounds like fate has spurred this confrontation.
Father, were are you?
Father?
Father?
Koyuki?
Come here.
Yes, stand right there.
What can you see there?
Father and me.
Look carefully.
You will be able to see your future.
Are you awake, Yukie-san?
Sandaiyuu, can you bring me water?
My head feels like it's spinning.
I think I may be hallucinating, but it feels like I'm swaying. No, it's not your imagination.
Eh?
What the hell is this?!
I don't like that lady.
What are you saying, Naruto?
Whatever happens, we have to protect her.
This is an important mission. | (On book: Come Come Paradise) Mission?
That's right, it's an A-Rank mission.
A-Rank mission?
I don't think it will be that hard just to protect a single actress. That's not true, Sasuke.
That's because famous people always get targeted.
And we don't know who the enemies are, | so don't let your guard down. Lights okay, mic okay.
Cameras okay.
Put in your best effort!
Start it from the test!
Yes!
Alright, scene 23, cut 6, take 1, action!
Shishimaru, hang in there!
Your Highness... I'm sorry to be of no use...
What are you saying?
Page 7/23
Because of you, and the courage you gave us...
Your Highness...
I wanted to see the other side of the rainbow together with you... Shishimaru...
What great drama...
That's entirely different from how she acts in real life... That is Yukie-sama.
As soon as the camera starts rolling, there | isn't anyone who can act like her!
Okay, stop.
What is it?!
Sandaiyuu, I need the eye drops.
The eye drops.
Yes, yes, yes.
Good enough?
It is going to overflow!
Hurry up and get the film rolling!
Geez, we don't have a choice.
Hey, we are going to take it right away.
Yes!
Alright, scene 23, cut 6-2. Action!
Shishimaru!
D-D-Director!
We're in trouble!
This is...
When I woke up this morning, the route was blocked!
What should we do?
We can do it here!
Eh?
You fool!
Can't you see that this is the ideal location?
How can we afford not to film in such a place?!
Eh?!
This is what you call it when the "God of Movies" arrives. Everyone get ready to land!
We will be filming, so please stand by.
Okay, scene 36, cut 22. Action!
So you have come all the way here!
Princess Fuun!
You are Mao!
Your Highness, please stay back!
We will deal with him!
Whatever your numbers, you are no match for me.
What is the meaning of this?
Page 8/23
What are you doing?!
Everyone, get back!
Welcome to the Snow Country.
You are...
I welcome you, Princess Koyuki.
Did you bring the hexagonal crystal?
Princess Koyuki?!
As expected of Hatake Kakashi.
I can't get any closer to you than here.
Sasuke, Naruto, Sakura,
You guys go and protect Yokie-san.
Everyone go and return to the ship!
Fubuki, Mizore, get Princess Koyuki.
Yeah.
Oh well, oh well.
It's been a while, Kakashi.
You're not going to run away this time?
Like last time?
Rouga Nadare.
I don't know exactly what's going on, | but it seems just like the movies! Princess Fuun! I will protect you!
Hyouton Tsubame Fubuki! | (Ice Element, Swallow Attack)
Katon, Goukakyuu no Jutsu!
Everyone hurry up and return to the ship!
Yukie-san!
Your Highness!
Sandayuu...
You...
Hyouro no Jutsu! | (Ice Prison Technique)
Princess?
Naruto!
Suiton, Suiryuudan no Jutsu! | (Water Element, Water Dragon Blast Technique)
Sacrifice your lives and keep on shooting!
Show pride in our work!
Sensei,
there's something weird about that armor!
That is the Snow Country's armor designed especially for ninja. It's chakra armor.
Chakra armor?
They are more powerful than before.
You remembered?
This armor increases my chakra and strengthens my techniques. It creates a wall of chakra around the body.
Page 9/23
And it even nullifies your chakra and reflects it back to you. It doesn't matter what kind of ninjutsu | or genjutsu you use, they won't work.
Hyouton, Haryuu Muuko! | (Ice Element, Piercing Dragon Fierce Tiger) Suiton, Suiryuudan! | (Ice Element, Piercing Dragon Fierce Tiger) Get out of the way, little girl!
You brat!
What is this chakra?!
Yukie-san, hurry!
Hurry up and return to the ship!
Your Highness!
Father!
What are you doing?!
Hurry up and go!
Your Highness, let's hurry back to the ship.
No.
We must hurry, or your life will be...
I don't care if I die!
I'm not going!
I'm not going to the Snow Country!
Quit being so selfish!
Get lost!
Sakura-chan!
Your highness!
I told you that you are my opponent!
Hyouton, Itsukaku Hakuegei! | (Ice Element, One Horned Whale) I see, that's quite a powerful jutsu.
Well then, I'll get serious.
Naruto! Gather everyone and run!
Hyouton, Itsukaku Hakusei!
As usual, you copied it.
You can't beat me with the same jutsu.
Beat you?
I'm sorry, but I won't meet your expectations.
What?
Cut!
Wow, we just filmed a great movie...
It has been ten years since that time...
We've reached the harbor.
Sandayuu-san, you knew about this, right?
Yes.
You must have know how she would | react if she were to return here. This is the only way that I could bring | the princess back to this country.
Page 10/23
Old man Sandayuu!
Princess Fuun is just someone in the movie, | she isn't a real princess. She is a real princess.
Fujikaze Yukie is a fake name.
She is really Kazahana Koyoki, the heiress of the Snow Country. The last time I was with her, she was very young. |
It's not surprising that she does not remember me.
Sandayuu-san, you're also from the Snow Country?
Yes, that's right.
I used to serve at the side of this country's | previous king, Kazahana Sousetsu-sama.
The Snow Country was a small, but peaceful country.
(On Wall:
Sousetsu-sama loved the princess very much | and they lived a very peaceful life.
But ten years ago, that incident...
Sousetsu-sama's younger brother Dotou,
hired some ninja, revolted, and took over this country.
He burnt the beautiful Kazahana Castle, and | we thought that we'd lost the princess.
Don't expose your face! The enemy will find us!
I couldn't win against them at that time. I had to run away. I had no choice but to run away...
Father!
I found the princess when she was on stage.
I was overjoyed...
...at how she... how she managed to survive...
It would have been better if I had died that day.
Please don't say that.
To us, that fact that you are still alive is our hope!
Even if I am still alive, my heart is already dead.
Ever since that incident, my tears have dried up.
After the incident, I somehow managed | to become Fujikaze Yukie's manager. And I waited until I finally got the chance | to bring the princess back to this country.
Eh? So all this time, you were using us?
No. Well... I apologize for fooling all of | you, but this is for the Snow Country.
Princess Koyuki!
You must overthrow Dotou, and be our new Queen!
I, Sandayuu, will protect you with my life!
So please fight with us!
No.
Page 11/23
Wha..?
Don't joke with me.
But the people of the Snow Country...
That's none of my business.
I refuse.
Your Highness...
Give it up already!
Are you stupid?
No matter how hard you try, | there is no way you can defeat Dotou! Don't say the words "give up" that easily!
This old man is risking his life to make that dream come true. If you make fun of him, I'll never forgive you!
Naruto-dono... | (Note:-dono is an honorific used to address samurai)
(Note:
Because you wou,dn't give up, you'll be able to see a dream. Because you're able to see a dream, the future will come. This is nice. What a perfect theme for the | final chapter of The Unlucky Princess.
D-Director... don't tell me that you are going to continue filming... I told you that this movie is changing...
No way!
Think about it.
Using a real princess and making it a movie.
It's something that happens once in a lifetime.
Oh, I see. It's going to be a great success, and | we can film the movie and earn big bucks.
If we do this, it is going to be a real hit!
Wait a second!
Unfortunately, there is only one option left.
There isn't a place where you can hide, | now that Dotou has discovered you.
To fight is the only way for you to live.
Kakashi-sensei...
Okay! The mission will continue!
Princess Fuun will go on to the Snow Country | and defeat the evil commander!
Don't fool around!
Reality is different from the movie.
There is no such thing as a happy ending anywhere in this world! If you put in the effort, you will be able to pull through! For such a mission, we should return | to the village and get more people. That would be a waste of time.
We are enough for this mission.
Page 12/23
You all...
So it's decided.
The filming will continue!
Let's make it a movie with a happy ending!
Yeah!
At the other side of this large cave, there is | a village where our comrades are gathered.
After we finish filming here, | we are planning to make a formal visit. Everyone is waiting for the princess' arrival, | more than tou can possibly know.
I can't see the exit.
Long ago, this place used to be a railway.
Railway?
Right now, it's covered by ice, but | really the tracks are underneath. Alright! We'll start the filming!
D-Director! Big problem!
What is it this time?
Yukie ran away again!
What?!
Don't fool around...
Don't fool around with me!
We will split up from here to search for her.
If you find her, make contact by radio!
Understood!
Look carefully, you should be able to see your future.
I can't see anything.
You will.
That's right. When Spring comes, you'll be able to see it. Spring?
Father, you liar.
There is no Spring in this country.
Geez, how many times do you have to | run away before you're satisfied? Everyone is waiting.
Why is it always you who finds me?
Because it's my mission.
Even if you don't like it, I will chase you wherever you go. I just know... by your smell.
Go back.
I will just act in front of the camera.
I'm not going to do anything else.
What is it?
It's chakra.
There is a small amount of chakra flowing | through the rail, and it's melting the ice.
Page 13/23
They're coming.
Everyone! Hurry up and run away!
We'll be in be in trouble if we get caught!
Sandayuu-san?
Where are you planning to go?
T-Train...!
Train? What's a train?
That thing?!
We'll be run over!
We will not!
It's impossible!
I will not give up!
It's definitely impossible!
Shut up and be quiet!
Even if you do this, it's pointless!
It's over!
I will not let it end!
I will never give up!
If you say that you are going to give up, | I will try harder and never give up!
Why you, why you...
It's been a while, Koyuki.
Kazahana Dotou.
So, it's been ten years?
Now, let me see your face.
Everyone! Our Princess Koyuki is watching.
Victory will be ours!
Yeah!
What?
Sandayuu?
Kazahana Dotou!
Do you know how long we have waited for this day?
I am Asabasan Sandayuu, a representative of the 50th Brigade. Now, we will avenge the death of Kazahana | Sousetsu-sama from a decade ago.
And we will take it out on you!
Yeah!
There are still people like that around?
My deepest apologies.
I will go now and deal with them.
No.
They need to experience something that is absolutely hopeless. Go!
Sandayuu...
Page 14/23
Wait, Sasuke, don't follow them any further.
This is so cruel.
That is the result of their persistence.
If they hadn't gone up against Dotou, they | wouldn't have ended up like this.
Your Highness...
I am very sorry...
...to get tou involved in this.
I, and everyone else...
Because you were around, we didn't lose our hope.
Ever since you were young, and even | now, you were always our princess. That's what I, Sandayuu, believe that you are...
Please believe in yourself...
You are our hope.
Your Highness...
Please... don't cry...
You really are stupid, Sandayuu.
I cannot cry because you have the eye drops.
You should be satisfied.
Let's go home.
If we stay in this country any longer, | you won't be able to return safely.
We're heading back.
What are you going back to?
Your home country is right here, isn't it?
If you really want to go back, then defeat | Dotou and go back to your home!
You don't know anything.
There is no Spring in this country.
It's a place where your tears freeze | and your heart will turn to stone! But you're able to change that, right?
At least... I think Sandayuu-san believed in that.
Stop talking nonsense!
Hey, wait!
Leave me alone!
Oh shit!
Sakura, where is Naruto?
No way, don't tell me...
Do you think I will let you go so easily?
Kage Bunshin no Jutsu!
You have become beautiful, Koyuki.
Do you have the hexagonal crystal?
Yes.
That's good.
Page 15/23
Because that's the only thing that connects | the Kazahana family as a whole.
And it's also the key to the treasure.
The key to the treasure?
When I took over this country from your father,
there was nothing left of the Kazahana family.
Sousetsu surely must have kept the treasure elsewhere. I looked for it, and I finally found it.
It's a massive weapon hidden in the Rainbow Glaciers. And I have found a keyhole that fits the hexagonal crystal. It I get hold of the Kazahana's weapon,
our country will have the power to overcome | the five other shinobi nations!
I will never let that happen!
You!
You bastard!
How did you get in here?
Don't underestimate a ninja.
My deepest apologies.
That kid was quite troublesome.
Oh, so he can use Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu? | (Mass Shadow Clone Technique)
I don't understand it well, but this kid...
It seems that he has an enormous amount of chakra.
Just in case anything happens, should we attach the device? Yes, we have an interesting guinea pig.
What?
It is a chakra control device.
The ultimate technique for sucking out chakra.
And it creates an impenetrable wall around him.
He won't be able to pull it off nor will he be able to destroy it. There's no way.
My power... is fading...
You're not a real ninja.
Just a little brat.
Damn it...
Now then, will you hand over the hexagonal crystal?
This is...
Don't fool around with me! This is just a fake!
That's not possible...
Hatake Kakashi...
What?
I see.
He'd be able to switch it easily.
Page 16/23
We will bring Kakashi right away.
There is no need for that.
They will soon come here.
And I shall wait until then.
Damn it...
My power doesn't even kick in...
Damn it. If I had known something like this was gonna happen, | I would have trained more in Nawanuke no Jutsu. | (Escape Techniques) (Escape Techniques)
Even if I am not able to use my chakra, being able to do | something in such circumstances makes me a real ninja.
Well deserved.
You too.
I guess so.
Spring...
There is no Spring... What does that mean?
"When it is Spring, you will be able to see."
That's what my father said.
Father, what is Spring?
I see. You haven't seen Spring before, right?
Right.
Koyuki, close your eyes.
Imagine a flower garden.
Isn't it beautiful?
And then imagine yourself running around in that place. How does it feel?
Doesn't it feel warm and make you happy?
Yes!
That is what you call Spring.
Don't give up, and believe in the future.
Some day, Spring will definitely come.
But there is no Spring in this country.
My father died, I ran away from this country, | and I decided to stop believing.
I keep on running and running away, and | I keep on telling lies. I even lie to myself.
So I act like other people.
I can only be an actress, there is nothing else for me. Even if you do that, nothing is going to change.
See?
You have to give up in the end.
If you give up, I'm sure it'll be quite a relief.
No one will bother you,
or even pay attention to you.
Page 17/23
It was alright, but it was still really painful.
I felt there was no place for me in this world.
But...
But...
But... I have good friends now.
And when I tried my best and | didn't give up, good things happened! If you give up, your dreams, and | everything else, will end right here! Stop it!
Your dad, old man Sandayuu...
I will prove...
...that they weren't wrong!
Naruto...
I'll save you right now...
It's an enemy raid!
That Kakashi. So he planned a night assault, eh?
It's going according to plan.
Hey since when...?
I said not to underestimate a ninja.
Damn it!
Wait, wait, Naruto!
It's me!
Kakashi-sensei!
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I am glad to see the princess is well.
Yes.
You switched the hexagonal crystal for a fake one, didn't you? I'm Sorry.
I figured that those guys were after it.
Just for this...
We can't hold that area any longer.
Sakura-chan!
Sasuke!
Down here!
Dotou.
Well done, Koyuki.
Wait!
Don't tell me...
Everyone seems to have forgotten,
that I am an actress.
It's true.
Koyuki acted the whole scene.
Yes, the whole thing is an act.
That's why I said...
I am an actress!
Page 18/23
Damn you!
Princess!
I knew about this, Naruto.
When I returned here was when I would die.
That's why at least...
Stop it! Princess!
Naruto... it was all thanks to you...
Until the very, very end... I kept running away...
No!
What you are doing right now is the same as running away! You can't die!
Father...
Sandayuu...
Princess!
I am not going to die from this toy-like katana.
That's right!
This is the new advanced model of chakra armor!
Don't touch her with your dirty hands!
Naruto!
It's pointless.
Your chakra is completely sealed!
Well, let's go Koyuki. To the place beyond the rainbow.
Damn it.
Naruto!
Damn it...
I will never give up...
Even if you don't like it, | I will follow you wherever you go. Damn it!
Hop on!
So I ended up here after all...
Sakura, now?
Just a little bit more!
I get it!
After five seconds, turn twenty degrees | left and run thirty meters ahead! That's where the tree branch is!
Alright!
Whatever you do will be useless!
I told you that it's useless!
Sakura Fubuki no Jutsu! | (Sakura Blizzard Technique)
As if.
We Snow ninja aren't that weak!
Maybe.
Shishi Rendan! | (Lion Combo)
What happened?
Page 19/23
I'm not sure...
...but maybe...
Do you have any chance of winning?
After all, you ran away last time.
It can't be helped.
I'll show you something original.
Raikiri! | (Lighting Edge)
Hyouton! Rouga Nadare no Jutsu! | (Ice Element, Rouga Nadare's Technique) What...?
That was so close.
Even if ninjutsu and genjutsu don't work | on you, a shinobi still has taijutsu!
You've depended too much on that armor!
Where is the treasure?
Where is the treasure?!
It's getting warm... This is...
A generator?!
Is this what you call Kazahana's treasure?!
Princess!
Naruto!
Hyoton, kokuryuu Boufuusetsu! | (Ice Element Black Dragon Blizzard) Naruto!
What's wrong?
It's not affecting me at all...
Naruto, stop it!
This time, you will really die!
Believe in me!
If you believe in me,
I will definitely...
...not lose!
No way... Don't tell me that his chakra is leaking out... Die!
Take this!
Chidori!
As if that level of jutsu would work against me!
Naruto... I made a crack...
You handle the rest...
Naruto!
Hey, Demon Fox, stop lying there doing nothing!
Show me your stuff!
What is that?
What?!
I will pay back what you did to me...
...with compound interest!
Page 20/23
What big words!
Souryuu Boufuusetsu!
It's all over.
From now on, everything is over!
I told you, it's not over yet.
If you say something is over, it means | that justice prevails and evil loses!
It's obvious that the story will have a happy ending!
Naruto!
I will believe in you! This Unlucky Princess | has accepted you as the greatest ninja!
That...
...I already know!
The seven color chakra,
just like in the movie.
Take this! Rasengan!
What?!
Don't tell me!
Is this some kind of alternate world?!
Believe in the future.
If you do, Spring will come.
Koyuki, what would you like to do when Spring comes?
I'll become a princess.
Hm, what kind of princess?
Hm... A kind, strong one.
A princess who believes in justice!
That's going to be very hard work.
I did say that before...
But if you don't give up and keep on believing in your dreams, one day, for sure, you will become one.
Can you see...
...that a very beautiful princess is standing here?
But I am not quite decided yet.
There is one more thing that I want to become.
What is it?
An actress!
And this is one happy ending.
I fire from walking | the raindrops hit my face.
Out here chasing an uncatchable rabbit.
I can see deep into your eyes,
like the bubbling water in the depths of a dark sea.
You're calling out to me, to me...
I'm right here.
Where, where should I go...
Page 21/23
...to satisfy these desires?
Let's head home, and then tomorrow,
will you smile and say, "Everything is all right"?
I call out your name, your name...
I'll give you a warm embrace.
Just close your eyes and remember our childhood days.
You make up for the areas that I am lacking.
I've forgotten all about the sad times,
so I'm not scared at all.
Now I've lied, and I feel remorse...
Somehow, I managed to grow up.
Now I feel ashamed, and I nervously sweat...
But even still, I've found a reason to continue the dance. I scorch my soul, scorch my soul... | I'm yelling out to the heavens! If I just open that door, that door, | I'll be saved.
Let's head home, and then,
let's meet that white rabbit | on the dark side of the moon. Let's head home, and then tomorrow,
we'll laughing in our bare feet.
You're calling out to me, to me...
I'll give you a warm embrace.
Just close your eyes and remember our childhood days.
After all, the device was incomplete.
So it's going to be Winter again?
No, not at all. We will use that device | and study it, and if we refine it,
then some day the Snow Country | will be called the Spring Country. But you know, it's going to be a waste.
You're so popular, and now you're going to quit acting. Who said that I will stop acting?
As the monarchy and the actress of the Snow | Country, I will show that I can do both.
It's stupid to give up,isn't it? | (On Movie Script: Come Come Paradise) T-That's...
Well then, see ya!
I can see deep into your eyes,
like the bubbling water in the depths of a dark sea.
Please sign here!
Please give me your autograph!
Yes, yes.
I call out your name, your name...
